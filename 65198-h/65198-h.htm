<p class='line0'>It was as if the soul had come</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;From out its deep recess</p>
<p class='line0'>And chose a dwelling in her eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So pure their loveliness!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And softly on her pearly cheek</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The dewy lashes lay;</p>
<p class='line0'>Her lips were parted temptingly</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To woo the breeze to stay;</p>
<p class='line0'>Her snowy neck all droopingly</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Defied the lily’s grace;</p>
<p class='line0'>Her dimpled mouth—I dreamt of heav’n</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In gazing on that face!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She fondled artlessly her pet;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She raised his tiny feet;</p>
<p class='line0'>And toyed the garland on his neck;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And soothed him, when he bleat,</p>
<p class='line0'>So sweetly that I might not hear</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Unmoved that silver tone,</p>
<p class='line0'>But longed to leave my hiding place</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And woo her for my own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A shot re-echoed through the wood,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I saw the smoky wreath—</p>
<p class='line0'>The lamb was bleeding in her lap</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The glancing ball beneath—</p>
<p class='line0'>I sprang and raised the sufferer</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And staunched the ebbing tide,</p>
<p class='line0'>And carefully I bound the wound,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And sat me by her side.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I quieted her quick alarm,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I gently soothed her fears,</p>
<p class='line0'>And o’er the dying favorite</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We mingled tears with tears:</p>
<p class='line0'>I shared her grief, and calmed her woe,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And blamed the sportsman rude—</p>
<p class='line0'>She raised her swimming eyes to mine</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And smiled her gratitude.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She faintly smiled and dropped her gaze,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her passive hand I took,</p>
<p class='line0'>No word was spoke, we only heard</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The murmur of the brook;</p>
<p class='line0'>Her gaze was on the murdered lamb,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her heart was strangely moved—</p>
<p class='line0'>She sighed, and oh! the loss she felt,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The void where once she loved.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Again I soothed her maiden grief,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And sighed whene’er she sighed,</p>
<p class='line0'>And with such winning sympathy</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her starting tears I dried,—</p>
<p class='line0'>And when she ceased I sighed myself,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And she besought to know</p>
<p class='line0'>All artlessly and innocent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The secret of my woe.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I told her it was all herself,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That I had paused to gaze,</p>
<p class='line0'>And that her witching loveliness</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Would sadden all my days;</p>
<p class='line0'>And then I sighed, and looked away,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And told her how I grieved,</p>
<p class='line0'>Not for myself, but for the pang</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her gentle heart received.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I asked her but to pity me,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And told my grief to part—</p>
<p class='line0'>Her fingers trembled, and I heard</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The beating of her heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all dissolved in sympathy</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She yielded to my side—</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A LEGEND OF GERMANTOWN.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY OLIVER OLDFELLOW.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> a man becomes so far lost to a sense of self-importance,
as not only to tell, but actually to <span class='it'>write
stories</span>,—thus recording his turpitude in black and
white—it is not to be presumed that slight consequences
will deter him from his purpose. Indeed,
it is rather to be supposed that he has made up his
mind to despise public opinion, and to brave all indignation.
His hand is sure to follow as his pen may
lead, and whatever he may <span class='it'>resolve</span>, when the story
is written, it is, somehow or other, sure to find its
way into print. The best motives of a writer may
therefore be mistaken, or his strongest resolves puffed
to the winds by a single breath, so that it may well
be supposed in what a predicament we were, when
we found our best intentions frustrated, and had to
encounter the wrath and tobacco smoke of our German
neighbors, and were obliged to write this apologetic
introduction, and all through a villanous blunder
of our greedy devil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts are these. We sat down, a few evenings
since, after enjoying a comfortable cup of pure Java,—which
we still continue to enjoy, notwithstanding
the anathemas of a fellow with a villanous name, of
“bran bread” repute,—to commit to paper a few
notes of a conversation which we had with a relative
long since. Having unluckily fallen into a doze, our
devil, who had been going about for more than an
hour roaring for copy, took a peep into the sanctum,
and, seeing how matters stood, slipt off the following
article, “in the crack o’ a thumb,” by way of filling
up an odd form, which, in an unlucky fit of liberality,
we had resolved to squeeze into the present number.
It may well be supposed that, before we had fairly
rubbed our eyes open, the <span class='it'>matter</span> was blown to the
world, and a whole avalanche of country cousins,
who hail from Germantown, were down upon us. Of
course we said at once that the article was not ours,
as no man can be expected to acknowledge his guilt
until it is proved upon him. This, however, did not
satisfy them, although they professed to have no difficulty
in believing it, for they continued to smoke
their pipes with such fury, and swore so stoutly in
real jaw-breaking Dutch—for every mother’s son is
German, even to the cut of his pantaloons—that we
were glad to get off upon the condition of making a
handsome apology, which we think we have now
fully done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many delightful villages in Pennsylvania,
which owe their origin to German settlers, and
maintain, amid surrounding improvements, the unchanged
marks of ancestry, there is none more prominent
than Germantown. It is but half an hour’s
drive from Philadelphia, extending along the main
road for more than two miles, with, for the most
part, old-fashioned stone houses, which date prior to
the revolution, sprinkled plenteously on both sides of
the road, forming a village of most unconscionable
length, but—like the pockets of most dandies of the
present day—with no depth or body to support its
extensive pretensions. It is famous in history, as
being the ground of a battle during the struggle for
independence, in which victory, though for a time
doubtful, declared for the enemy, in consequence of
the incompetency of an American officer. The present
inhabitants are mostly the descendants of German
families—true sprigs of the old branches, imitating
most of the virtues of their forefathers, indulging
in no luxuries, pursuing a rigid economy, and
clinging with an unyielding regard to the money bequeathed
them. Nor is this regard in any degree
weakened by the devices of those who have recently
settled in the village, and who vainly hope by improving
their houses, fitting up their grounds, and
clipping and beautifying their shrubbery, to induce
an imitation of their example. The old-roof tree
stands, as it stood half a century ago, and the very
stones of the building, from between which the mortar
has in many cases long since dropped, grin defiance
on the passer by, who dares to harbor a thought
of improvement or repair. The owner is content to
<span class='it'>live</span> as his ancestors lived, but would like to <span class='it'>die</span> a
little richer. The patrimony, amassed by the hand
of unceasing toil, is religiously bequeathed from sire
to son, together with the peculiar habits of thought
and the superstitious sentiments of an age gone by.
In many cases no education has been suffered to
weaken or invade, and in others has been so slight as
only to harmonize the mind with the general character
of the place, which at best seems to belong
more to a past generation than to the present. From
these causes, things which better tutored minds scout
with scorn, in the one case, are held as true as matters
of religious belief, and in the other are only
doubted, not disbelieved. In fact so thoroughly does
superstition, and the gross follies which an intercourse
with the world and education always dispel,
prevail, that many of the inhabitants can tell you to
a nicety when there will be a change of weather, by
the belligerent attitude in which the moon turns up
her horns when she grows restive, and that there will
be company when the cat licks her paws, when a fork
sticks up in the floor, or when the old cock brushes
up his feathers and crows in the door-way. There
are others who go still deeper into mysteries of this
sort, and can predict to you a birth, a marriage, or a
death, by the kinks in a cow’s tail; but as they are
entirely beyond our depth, and seem to have this
knowledge all to themselves, it may be well not to
disturb them in their profound wisdom. Nevertheless,
let no young man, who values the affections of
any fair Dutch damsel in Germantown, venture to
present her with a pair of scissors, unless he wishes
to <span class='it'>cut</span> the sentimental cord that binds her to him.
Thus much we feel in duty bound to record as a
warning to young gentlemen, as many a man has lost
the confidence and affections of his lady love in consequence
of less matters than a pair of scissors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might be expected that a village so contiguous
to a great city, would soon lose these distinctive
marks of character, and that the extravagance, follies
and vices of the metropolis would be generally
imitated. Not so, however. With very little exception,
the place is as entirely distinct as if it were
miles in the interior. The moral mantle of Germanism
seems to hang like a cloud over the place, and,
blended with the superstition of the portion of inhabitants
spoken of, there is a high-toned morality
so imbedded in the hearts of the people, that honesty
and a strict regard to truth, next to making money
and keeping it, may be considered the great texts by
which they live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will easily be understood that among a people
thus constituted, a <span class='it'>ghost</span> has but to be <span class='it'>seen</span> by one of
their number, and his appearance announced, to be
generally dreaded. If he has been <span class='it'>seen</span>, there is an
end of all doubting, and the only thing thereafter to
be done, is to keep out of his way. There will be
no use, in such a case, to multiply arguments about
him, but every man must take care of himself. And,
what may seem a little singular, a good sound-minded,
rational apparition will, in all cases, most delight
to visit a people who pay him so much deference;
taking especial care to show himself off frequently,
and in all manner of ways, that there may be no
doubt that he does exist in one shape or another, and
having established the matter to his own satisfaction,
that it is better to range the upper world, where he
can be <span class='it'>seen</span>, than to dwell below in the dark, damp
ground of the tomb, where he cannot be seen, where
his very existence may be doubted, and where, at the
best, the quarters are most uncomfortably chilly,—we
say a sane ghost, under such circumstances, would
naturally grow familiar—or rather <span class='it'>attempt</span> to—and
having sought out and established himself in comfortable
quarters, and having enjoyed an oblivious
nap during the day, would seek to regale himself in
the evening, after his own will and pleasure, by little
trips by moonlight, over the fields, around the old
barns, and especially on the tops of the <span class='it'>stone fences</span>—if
any there be—of the neighborhood. A ghost
certainly has the right, if any <span class='it'>body</span> has, of doing
pretty much as he pleases, and of keeping out of the
dust and gravel of a country side-walk, and of cutting
up his antics, by way of recreation, on the top
of a stone wall. At least these were the sentiments
entertained by the ghost in question, and he took the
liberty—unlike most politicians—of acting them
out without regard to consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, early in November, 18—, the inhabitants
of the goodly village of Germantown were
thrown into great consternation and dismay, by the
important intelligence that a ghost had been seen
the previous evening, perched upon Chew’s wall,
dressed in white, and rattling a heavy chain, which
some maintained he had been hung in, in consequence
of some great crime. Some said that it was only a
log-chain, which he intended to use, after his own
fashion, on the first man he got in his clutches, while
others, with a great show of reason, maintained that
the chain was fastened around <span class='it'>his own ankle</span>, and
that he was no less a <span class='it'>personage</span> than the ghost of the
dead soldier who had deserted from the British
during the revolution, and was accidentally shot
during the battle of Germantown, while a prisoner
in a baggage-wagon, <span class='it'>as had been said</span>, but who, it
was very likely, had been murdered during the heat
of the fray, by some enemy in his own ranks—a
rival in love, perhaps, or an heir to some estate, who
wished him out of the way. Be all this as it may,
the ghost had been <span class='it'>seen</span> upon the wall, and he had a
chain about him in some way, and some unheard of
atrocity might confidently be looked for. The
greatest mystery of the affair was that as soon as the
rumor got on the wind, the man who had seen him
was no where to be found, nor could any body tell
who he was. Somebody <span class='it'>had</span> seen him, however, and
that was enough, and any inhabitant of Germantown
would as soon have doubted the existence of sour-krout—a
belief of which substantial proof was given
daily—as to have felt the least incredulity in regard
to the ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course all the inhabitants put on the gravest
looks possible, and kept a sharp look-out, but still
nearly a week passed and no tidings of a renewal of
the visit of his ghostship occurred. Sunday morning
came, and the matter was duly canvassed before the
church door, prior to the arrival of the minister. A
great many solemn shakes of the head and knowing
winks were given on the subject. It was formally
resolved that fires had better be kept burning in all
the ovens for a fortnight, though it was pretty generally
agreed that the ghost had been taken unawares,
and that, whatever his business to that place might
be, by keeping off the wall for a week, it was a pretty
good sign that he did not want to show himself, and
therefore he would be more cautious in future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ghost, notwithstanding all these sage conclusions,
resolved to have his own way in the matter,
and accordingly made his appearance <span class='it'>that very evening</span>—not
in white, nor in the form of a man, but in
<span class='it'>black</span>, and running on all fours, like a hyena, on the
top of the wall, and even proceeded so far as to
throttle a very inoffensive person, and one who never
could have had any thing to do with the murder—if
indeed the apparition was the ghost of the murdered
soldier. The facts of this encounter are these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christopher Burger (such was the name of the person
throttled) or “<span class='it'>Stoffel</span> Burger,” as his German
friends delighted to dub him in abbreviation, was a
stout, square-built young fellow, of about twenty-two,
who could do his day’s work, and dance the whole
night through in the bargain, without thinking of
fatigue. He had fallen in love, at a quilting party,
with Miss Susan Hanz, a blooming Dutch damsel of
seventeen summers; and, like a straight-forward
business-like German, as he was, he resolved to
make her his wife. She was, in fact, just the girl to
inspire Christopher with the sentimental. Short,
thick, and as elegantly shaped as a churn, with a
full, round, saucy face, lighted up with a pair of
brilliant black eyes, and with a foot, which, if it was
<span class='it'>not</span> one of the smallest, could go through “a straight
four,” or, for that matter, if occasion required it, a
regular “hoe down,” with a grace that actually made
Christopher’s heart leap, as if it was going to jump
out of his mouth. Nor were these her only claims to
regard. The fair Susan was an only child, and her
father had the reputation of possessing more than
one stocking full of <span class='it'>the real currency</span>, carefully
stowed away in the large walnut chest under the bed.
Two or three broad farms also claimed ’Squire Hanz
as owner, and spread themselves out very temptingly
before the eager eyes of “Stoffel.” And then, what
a hand at baking hot cakes!—his mouth actually
watered at the thought. Added to all this, he well
knew that if he succeeded in winning the heart of the
fair Susan, no obstacle would be placed in the way
of his happiness by the ’Squire. In this matter the
’Squire was exceedingly liberal; he imposed but one
condition upon his daughter in relation to the man of
her choice, and that was, that “he must be of a good
German family.” To “<span class='it'>Stoffel</span>” there could be no
objection on this score. His very name carried the
recommendation with it. Moreover, the ’Squire had
never had brother or sister, and therefore there were
no rascally cousins to be mining the fortress in his
absence. Had there been any, with stout purses in
their fists, the matter would not have been quite so
positive; for, as an <span class='it'>arrangement of convenience</span>, and
to <span class='it'>keep the money</span> from the hands of <span class='it'>grasping strangers</span>,
every man in the village of which we write
made it a point to marry his cousin—<span class='it'>if he could
get her</span>—and, if the truth must be told, the strong
voice of parental command was seldom wanting to
strengthen his suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let it not be supposed, however, that a lady with
such substantial claims had never been besieged with
lovers. Such <span class='it'>had been</span> the case. But “Stoffel”
having so far outstripped his rivals as to attain the
honor of <span class='it'>smoking a pipe alone</span> with the ’Squire a few
Sunday evenings previous to the time of which we
write, the business was looked on as settled, and the
whole bevy of Dutch beaux were off in the twinkling
of an eye, like a flock of partridges when they have
been shot at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christopher, thus having “a fair field and <span class='it'>all</span> the
favor,” was not the man to neglect the advantage;
so that, on the Sunday night in question, if an inquisitive
eye had been placed at the key-hole of the
’Squire’s parlor door, he might have been <span class='it'>seen</span>, or
<span class='it'>heard</span>, actually (we hope the ladies will skip this
passage)—we say he might have been <span class='it'>seen</span> kissing
Susan <span class='it'>in the dark</span>. Atrocious as this conduct was,
however, on the part of “Stoffel,” we are bound, in
recording a true narrative, to say that the lady was
not to be frightened at trifles; so, instead of screaming
out, and thus rousing the ’Squire and his blunderbuss,
she took the matter coolly, and, resolving not
to be outdone in civilities, gave him as good as he
sent, and, throwing her arms around his neck, <span class='it'>kissed
him</span>!! These, of course, are little attentions, on the
part of lovers, which should not be wantonly, and
without purpose, revealed to “the cold and heartless
world,” and we only mention them to show that
Christopher was a fellow with a pretty stout heart,
and thus prepare our readers for the horrible outrage
upon a brave man we are about to record. And considering,
too, that all our lady readers have skipped
the last passage, and are waiting breathlessly, we
proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now past twelve o’clock—we are ashamed
to record it—for Christopher, whatever wrong he
committed in <span class='it'>going</span> to the ’Squire’s every Sunday
evening, when he <span class='it'>returned</span>, his conscience, on that
score, was generally clear enough, as it was Sabbath
no longer. We say it was past twelve, and Christopher
set out for home. He had feasted on the best
the ’Squire’s cellar afforded, and had made way with
more than one mug of his best cider. The parting
scene, on the part of Christopher, had been unusually
tender. He was naturally an ardent lover, and the
cider by no means decreased the strength of his attachment.
He had used every argument to bring
Susan to the point of acceptance—still she was coy.
Yet Christopher was a man of discernment, and
thought that a lady who would throw her arms around
his neck and kiss him in the dark, (bless us! what
will the ladies say to this?) could have no serious
objection to him at bottom, and so, on the whole, he
was in a very pleasant mood with himself, and with
all <span class='it'>mankind</span> and <span class='it'>womankind</span> in the bargain, as gentlemen
usually are when the lady has been kind, and
the parting kiss has been freely given. He felt unusually
<span class='it'>happy</span>, and could not restrain the kind feelings
which bubbled up to his very lips and found vent
in snatches of songs. He was rapidly approaching
the wall—still he thought nothing of ghosts or hob-goblins,
but was ruminating very intently upon the
charms of the <span class='it'>substantial</span> little Dutch beauty, and
was going over in his mind, very pleasantly, her
qualifications to make him a happy man. He might
be said to be in that state, when a man is walking
yet dreaming. He was picturing a neat stone house,
with every <span class='it'>useful</span> article of furniture bought and
paid for, and with a horse and cow that he could call
his own. Milk punch, too, naturally enough popped
into his head, and then out again, to make room for
thoughts of hot cakes swimming in butter. His song,
however, still went on, as the music was not so difficult
of execution as to require much thought in its
performance—when the conclusion of a stanza
seemed suddenly to have been frozen on his lips, and
he started back with the ejaculation—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine Got! vat ish dat? der spooke—der divel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cause of his alarm the reader will understand,
and so did “Stoffel.” He had heard it rumored that
a ghost in white had been seen airing himself upon
Chew’s wall, and he was not the man to scoff at
rumor, and, even if he had been, there was the identical
thing before him, slightly changed in appearance,
it is true, not in white, nor sitting erect, but in
black, running along the wall towards him, like a
hyena or a bear; and, sure enough, as if to establish
his character beyond the possibility of a
doubt, <span class='it'>rattling his chain</span> with a clangor truly appalling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In any other situation Christopher, perhaps, would
have run, but in the present instance his limbs refused
to do their work, his knees knocked together,
his teeth set to chattering, and he seemed rooted to
the spot. Nor can it be supposed that he was a
coward, as we think the contrary has been clearly
demonstrated in his valiant exploits in courting. The
ghost, however, as if to settle the difficulty, to clear
all doubt in the mind of Christopher, and to prevent
any more profane exclamations, coolly descended
from the wall, and before he knew where he was,
knocked him down “with one blow of his <span class='it'>tail</span>,” as
was afterwards affirmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” said the ghost, “your time has come to
die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine Got, nay—I be’s—so young—and pin—tink—to
git—marry,” chattered the horror-stricken
Dutchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going to get married; ha! who do you
think will have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Squire—Hanz—Sus, me tinks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you marry her you will be a dead man,” said
the ghost in a hollow, sepulchral voice, “and unless
you stay away from ’Squire Hanz’s two months from
this time, remember I have warned you! you are a
dead man! Beware!” and having released his throat
from a loving squeeze, vanished, as Christopher asserted,
“in de ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he arose, his brain whirled, and his memory
was confused; the sun was just peeping over the
hills, and a group of astonished neighbours were
around him. Christopher told his story, and related
the adventure exactly as it had occurred, excepting
what related to Susan, that he kept close in his own
bosom—why? we cannot say. Some believed him,
but others, of the most knowing, shook their heads—guessed
he had drank too freely of the ’Squire’s
cider, and wondered how he knew “the ghost vanished
in the ground when he was lying on his face in the
dirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christopher asserted, and swore Dutch to substantiate
it, that he “had been <span class='it'>choked on the back of his
neck</span> until he saw stars,” and that after <span class='it'>that</span> the ghost
disappeared, and he knew nothing more of the matter
until he found the mob around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was conclusive! And as the contagion spread,
it was ascertained that the ghost had been exceedingly
obliging, and had appeared in a variety of forms and
costumes “to suit customers.” A stout troop of
good wives roundly asserted that he had crossed the
road in the form of a white calf, as they were proceeding
to meeting, and that when they screamed out
he disappeared. One had seen him in the habit of
an old woman, dangling a great bunch of keys at her
girdle, but it was plain he was no old woman at all
from the whisker on one side of his face, which proved
him to be the dead soldier. Moreover, he kept
rattling the keys with tremendous fury, and held up
his forefinger significantly; as much as to say “if
you disturb me I’ll knock you down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another averred that as she was walking along,
she heard a terrible flapping of wings, and looking up
she saw, what at first appeared to be a flock of wild-geese,
but they quickly changed into boys, and in an
instant all vanished but one, and he was a man with
a long white flowing robe, with which he took good
care to cover his head, so that she could not see
whether he had whiskers or no, and therefore could
not say whether it was the dead soldier or not. In
short, nearly all the <span class='it'>old</span> women had seen him, or had
a ghost story to <span class='it'>tell</span>, which answered the same purpose,
so that the good Dutchmen shook their heads
to no purpose, for the more they shook them the more
confused they became.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consequence was, that after the existence of
the ghost was thus substantiated, he resolved to confirm
the testimony by taking up his quarters for the
winter at once. This he did by establishing himself
in a neat two story brick house, which was formerly
located at the place now called “The Seven Oaks.”
Thus having made himself perfectly at home, and
we presume feeling himself so, for no body pretended
to disturb him in his selected quarters, he took his
recreations in various ways. Sometimes he would
appear with a winding sheet around him, and a flame
of fire coming out of his mouth, then he would walk
inhabited like a bear, or he might be seen in the form
of a dragon with a huge tail. To vary the entertainments,
he would appear with horrible horns on his
head, and a tail like a fish, and would go sweeping
over the ground as if he were gliding in water. He
appeared, too, at various places, though his favorite
resort was the top of the stone wall, which he would
often bestride, as if it were a full-blooded charger,
and would go whistling down the wind,—stone wall
and all. What rendered this last feat the more surprising
was, that when morning came the wall looked
as unmoved as if nothing had happened, but the ghost
was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be supposed that things should continue
in this state forever. Accordingly a number of the
more aged inhabitants having put their heads together,
it was thought advisable to devise some energetic
measures to relieve themselves of his ghostship.
Whereupon every man stuck his pipe in his mouth,
and set to smoking and thinking with great energy
and decision. After due reflection, various measures
were proposed, but none so feasible as that proposed
by ’Squire Hany, who having a pipe about a foot longer
than any of the others, came to the sagest conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His proposal was in substance, that a meeting be
called on the next evening, and that a committee
should be appointed to watch the ghost, and if possible,
to shoot through him with silver bullets; when,
it was affirmed, he would dissolve into thin air at
once. And lest the ghost should be aroused to commit
some deed of dire interest, as soon as the news of
these hostile proceedings reached his ears, it was
thought advisable that all the inhabitants should
close their doors at sundown, nail horse shoes over
them, and, to save candles if not their necks, they
should go to bed at dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large meeting of the indignant inhabitants, in
accordance with this decision, assembled at “The
Green Tree,” when, after calling “Stoffel Burger”
to the chair, the following resolutions, which had
been drawn up with great care and precision for the
occasion, were unanimously adopted:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>“<span class='it'>Resolved</span>, That a committee of eight be appointed
<span class='it'>to shoot the ghost</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Resolved</span>, That Stoffel Burger be chairman of the
committee to point him out, so that the silver bullets
be not thrown away, and also, to save powder, that
<span class='it'>nobody shall shoot the ghost till they see him</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the first branch of this resolution Stoffel felt
inclined to demur, and said that as he had already
been choked by the ghost, he would rather not get
in his clutches again. The meeting, however, had
made up their minds—as most town meetings generally
do—before hand, and would hear of no excuse.
It was therefore further</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Resolved</span>, That the meeting defray the expenses
of the committee, provided they follow instructions,
and that all the inhabitants be commanded to nail
horse shoes over their doors, so that the ghost may
be shot down without mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We said the resolutions were unanimously adopted,
but there was one young gentleman who, in the outset,
stoutly opposed them, but who, nevertheless, afterwards
gave them his hearty support. He was a good
looking fellow, about five feet ten in height, with a
piercing black eye, a most intelligent face, and a
whisker trimmed with such exquisite taste that every
girl of the village would take a peep out of the corner
of her eye and admire them while passing. His
tongue, too, was as slippery as an eel, and he could
say the softest and most honied words in a way that
actually put the stout Dutch phrases completely out
of tune. Nevertheless, he spoke German like a book,
and no man could exceed him in driving a bargain,
so that, having come from a German settlement in the
east, he went by the name of “The Dutch Yankee.”
He never obtruded his advice in any case, and only
suggested in this, “whether these hostile proceedings
might not inflame the anger of the ghost, and lead to
hot work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The valor of the meeting, however, was too highly
inflamed to listen for a moment to prudential hints,
when they had the iron argument of horse shoes
ready in case of danger, so that after selecting the
committee and charging them to “be true to their
country in this sudden and trying emergency, and to
meet promptly the next evening and perform their
duty,” the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following evening the committee accordingly
met at “The Green Tree,” armed to the teeth,
each man having, in addition to his musket charged
with the fatal bullet, a long butcher knife to be ready
for extremities. The host of “The Green Tree”
was in excellent spirits, and the committee resolved
at once to be so too if it could be done by dint of good
liquor. So in order to be prepared for the fierce encounter,
and to strengthen his nerves, each man
knocked off his half-pint at the outset. And as the
generous inhabitants had agreed to pay expenses,
there could be no harm, so thought both the committee
and the host, in drinking another, and as each
felt braver the more he drank, the experiment was
repeated in homœopathic doses until the hour of
twelve, when, we will venture to assert, a stouter
hearted set of men never set out on a perilous expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is strange, however, how soon the cold wind of a
winter night will unstring the nerves and set the teeth
to chattering, for no sooner were the valiant committee
within sight of Chew’s wall, and had been a
little chilled through with the night breeze, than
each man was seized with a tremendous shivering
of cold, and each feeling weaker than the other, it
was with great difficulty that they could get on, for
want of a leader. It was stoutly maintained that
“Stoffel” should go before, as he was commissioned
by the meeting to point out the ghost. To this Stoffel
agreed, but maintained that he could not show
him to the committee, unless they were with him. It
was finally settled that no man should have the <span class='it'>honor
of going alone</span>, but that they should all march up
abreast, and at the signal given fire a platoon into
him. So they set up at once a terrible yelling, in order
that the ghost might see that they were in earnest
and prepare for the consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was that the ghost heartily despised
their bullying mode of procedure, and determined to
show that there was no flinching on his part, by meeting
them more than half way, or that the heads of
the committee were rather giddy with having been
confined in the close air of a bar-room for so many
hours, and had thus caused them to miscalculate
distances; certain it was, that before they were aware
of their position, Stoffel espied the ghost and pointed
him out at not more than thirty yards distance. Every
man instantly cocked his musket, and affirmed that it
was <span class='it'>moving</span>, and that owing to the dreadful proximity
of the ghost, every thing else was dancing around
them. Accordingly they instantly poured a dreadful
volley into the offender and took to their heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the ghost was hit or not, it was clearly
ascertained the next morning that the committee had
succeeded in putting two silver balls into a great,
ugly old post, which had long been a serious annoyance,
and had split the rails of a contiguous fence
most shockingly. There were not wanting those who
were severe and uncharitable enough to say that the
committee had got a little drunk, and had fired <span class='it'>at</span> the
post. This, however, was deemed a gross slander,
and it was unanimously agreed that if the ghost had
stood where the post was, he would have had a ball
through him to a certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for “Stoffel,” having done this daring deed,
nobody caught him passing the wall for some weeks
after, and he gave people pretty clearly to understand
that he did not intend to for some weeks to come.
What tended to confirm the inhabitants in the opinion
that the vigilant committee had extirpated the dreaded
visitant, and that there was nothing like silver bullets
and horse shoes to quiet ghosts, whether in doors or out
was, he did not appear on the wall—when, unluckily
for our friend “Stoffel” and his milk punch and hot
cakes, “The Dutch Yankee,” who possessed the true
blood, succeeded in winning the heart of the fair
Susan, and actually eloped with the bouncing little
Dutch beauty, much to the amazement of the ’Squire,
and the horror of the astounded “Stoffel,” and actually
carried the enormity so far, as to write “Stoffel”
an invitation to the “home-bringing,” a month
or so afterward; coupling the request with a promise
that the ghost should not be allowed to disturb him
either in passing or repassing Chew’s wall without
due revenge. “Stoffel” did not like the tone of the
invitation, or considered that his valor in courting
and shooting ghosts was established, so he declined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the ghost still held his quarters privately
somewhere in the neighborhood, and enjoyed many
a pleasant little trip by moonlight for his own private
gratification after that, was not doubted by the good
people of the village, although he only condescended
to show himself to particular favorites, by <span class='it'>occasional
glimpses</span> when passing the wall. Lately, however,
he has been more chary of his visits, and it is supposed
that the rail road rather interfered with his
calculations, and that the eternal whizzing of steam
and the ringing of bells, rendered his quarters uncomfortable—particularly
since his house has rudely
been pulled down over his head, and a new one erected
on the same site, without regard to his convenience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were not wanting people who pretended to
laugh at the whole affair after the elopement and
marriage of the fair Susan, and it was maintained
that the Yankee was often seen to twist his face and
laugh to himself, when he was ploughing up the old
’Squire’s ground. Yet nobody in Germantown, <span class='it'>who
had heard the clanking of the chain</span>, ever ventured to
doubt the existence of the ghost, and if any of our
readers are inclined to disbelieve the story, the horse
shoes can yet be seen nailed over some of the doors,
and the bullet <span class='it'>holes</span> can yet be shown in the posts by
the road side,—some of the inhabitants having dug
the bullets out with the characteristic reflection,
“that it was a pity that good silver should be thrown
away, <span class='it'>even after ghosts</span>.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>THE CAPTAIN’S COURTSHIP.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> cloth had just been removed, at my second
dinner with the club, when the President called on a
Mr. Rowley for a story. He tossed off a tumbler of
Port—to clear the cobwebs, as he said, from his
throat—and began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all know I am a lawyer, and that men who
would be witty have a way of quizzing our profession
by saying that we cannot tell a story without dragging
in our craft. I have no objection to the notion
of these smart gentlemen, and shall not even trouble
myself to refute them, but go on with my story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was a student, just after the close of the
late war, I used to pay occasional visits to Mount
Holly, which was even then a passable county
town, and remarkable for its pretty girls, its gay
winters, and the quantity of wine drunk by its bar.
There wasn’t a lawyer in the place who couldn’t carry
his two bottles, and as for wit, these barristers were
famed for it from Cape May to Hackensack. But
it is not so much with the Mount Holly bar as with
Captain Slashbey, one of the clients of the wittiest
member there, that my story has to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I first met the gallant captain on a hunting excursion
into the pines. He was a portly little gentleman,
with a rubicund face, a constant flow of humor,
and an opinion of his own good looks rather singular,
I must say, at forty-five. He had very short legs
and a very round person, and altogether reminded
you of a fat pigeon walking upright. He had been
in the service during the war, and at the reduction of
the army, finding himself pretty well in debt, and
without a <span class='it'>sous</span> in his pockets, had settled at Squankum,
a place in the very heart of the cedar swamps.
And very convenient it was for Slashbey, for, like
Galway, in Ireland, a sheriff’s writ hadn’t been seen
there in the memory of man. It was once attempted
to execute a capias there, but the forgemen and
squatters rose in a mass, and though the light horse
were ordered out, the arrest had to be given up.
Now the captain was a popular man in Squankum,
and therefore was as safe as in a sanctuary. He
thirsted now and then, it is true, for the good things
of civilized life afar off, and would often make a dash
into Mount Holly, like a guerilla, taking care, however,
to retreat before his creditors had wind of his
approach. But at length he grew tired of this life,—I’ll
thank you for the bottle—and determined to
extricate himself from it by marrying an heiress;
for the captain was a gallant man, you must know,
and, like Will Honeycombe, had a high notion of
his own powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a merry little vixen at the county
town—a gay witty black-eyed rogue as ever lived—who
was, in the captain’s opinion, the very pattern
for a wife. She would have made an anchorite forswear
his creed, and was besides an heiress to a very
pretty fortune. Undaunted by the crowds of suitors
for her hand, Slashbey determined to enter the lists,
nothing doubting, on the faith of certain smiles with
which she always welcomed him, that he would carry
off the prize. He began his preparations like a Napoleon.
He bought a new pair of buff cassimeres,
endued a shining blue coat with metal buttons, and
ordered a wig from the most fashionable <span class='it'>perruquier</span>
in Philadelphia, for unluckily the captain was as bald
as a cannon ball. Thus accoutred, he laid regular
siege to his charmer, dancing her and sleighing her
whenever he could venture out of his cedar swamps
without being chased by a bailiff. The heiress
smiled on the captain, her suitors cursed the lucky
rival, and Slashbey spent his time betwixt studying
his glass and singing ‘none but the brave deserve
the fair.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just when he thought he was on the point
of success that a grand ball was given at ——, and
the captain, determining to carry his charmer by assault,
forgot his usual prudence and escorted the
heiress in his gig. Never did the little fellow look
more gallant. I was at the ball, and faith! could
scarcely keep my eyes off him. His wig was curled
irresistibly, his new coat shone with resplendent lustre,
his cassimeres fit him as a mould does a bullet,
and he sported his new buff gloves with more vanity
than a rider does his colors at a race. But, alas!
his glory was destined soon to wane. One of his
rivals, whose nose the captain had valorously pulled,
determining on revenge, had informed the sheriff of
Slashbey’s whereabouts, and just as he was leading
his charmer triumphantly to the dance, the myrmidons
of justice pounced on him, and after a desperate
struggle he was secured, on the charge of an assault
and battery. But this was not the worst. Before
the court opened the next day, a dozen writs in civil
suits had been lodged against his body. The captain
was beside himself. He trembled at the <span class='it'>exposé</span> of
his affairs—he trembled for his heiress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘We could laugh this battery out of court,’ he
said; ‘but what the devil can I do with these creditors?
I’m a ruined man. And to come just now, the
infernal rascals! Oh, Anna Matilda!’ he exclaimed
with a love-lorn look of his crow-feet eyes, ‘it’s all
up with you and your fortune now. What would the
fellows of the tenth say if they heard of it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Cheer up,’ said his attorney laughingly; ‘your
case will come up among the first, and we may yet
find a way to get you off. It’s all the result of envy.
These young boys can’t endure that Mars and Apollo
should meet together in your person,’ and the barrister
winked wickedly to me, as Slashbey, marshalled
by the sheriff, preceded us into the hall of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was with a rueful countenance that he took his
seat in the court. The room was densely filled with
the usual motley assemblage at a county sessions.
Loafers half in rags, and shopmen in the latest cut,
portly farmers with huge mud-stained boots, and drovers
carrying heavy loaded whips, here a sober Quaker
with a broad-rimmed beaver, and there a gay
young lawyer with more wit than briefs, long men
and short men, fat ones and lean ones, some with
merry round faces, and others with countenances as
sour as crab-apples, officers and loungers, attorneys
and clients, filled up every vacant space outside the
bar, whiling away the time until the appearance of
the judge, by speculating on the prospects of a crop,
or discussing the points of a case set down for trial
at the term. At length his honor made his appearance,
and, bustling and bowing through the crowd,
assumed the bench, wiped the perspiration from his
rubicund face, coughed with judicial gravity, and ordered
the crier to open the court. That high functionary
accordingly started to his feet, and in a nasal
twang mumbled over a formula which no one could
hear distinctly, but which appeared to be a recapitulation
of the iniquities of those in authority generally,
and of his honor in particular, as it ended with
a hope that God would save the commonwealth and
the honorable court. After the crier sat down, a
very lean man, with a very sharp nose, and a very
squeaking voice, called out ‘John Smith,’ whereupon
a little fat man jumped up and said ‘here;’ but the
clerk, without seeming to notice him, went on and
called Joseph Thomson, Zerubabel Thomson, Joab
Johnson, and the Lord knows how many more Thomsons
and Johnsons, all of whom severally jumped up
and said ‘here.’ Then, the jury being empannelled,
the case came on, and the attorneys got into towering
passions, and seemed as if they could have eaten
each other up, while the jury smiled and nodded, and
their foreman—the little fat man—stroked his chin
and looked extremely wise. After this was gone
through with, there was a general buzz through the
room, when suddenly the judge cried ‘order,’ and
then the sheriff cried ‘order,’ and the sleepy constables
and tipstaves opened their eyes and echoed
‘order’ more lustily than either; whereupon his
honor turned over one or two big books bound in
white calf,—ah! this is prime Port—consulted his
notes for a moment, and then proceeded to sum up
the evidence and charge the jury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next case was that of Slashbey—and the
same formality was gone through with until about
half of the jury had been sworn, when the attorney-general
rose to acquaint the court that the panel
was exhausted and that therefore he prayed a <span class='it'>tales</span>
from the lookers on. These few and simple words of
the attorney-general acted on the spectators like
the upsetting of a crowded bee-hive. Instantly
there was a great rush towards the door. Drovers
and farmers, shopmen and gentlemen, staid Quakers
and burly topers, all started in the race at once,
tumbling and scrambling over each other in their
haste to reach the entrance, while the tipstaves
shouted ‘order’ until they were hoarse, and the
sheriff and his deputies sprang to the door in order
to close it before the egress of their prey. It was a
moment of general confusion, and Slashbey was forgotten
in the <span class='it'>mêlée</span>. Even the judge had eyes only
for the scrambling fugitives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now,’ said I, nudging Slashbey, who sat by me
not far from the casement; ‘now’s your time—clear
the window at a leap—my horse Thunderer is fastened
not twenty yards off—ride like the devil, and
don’t draw rein till you get to Squankum.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slashbey understood my plan as readily and
rapidly as I had conceived it, and, just waiting to see
that the coast was clear, he placed his hands on the
sill, and, portly as he was, shot through the open
window like a bomb, unseen by all except his honor,
who caught sight of the fugitive’s coat tails as they
disappeared outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘An escape!’ shouted the judge, starting to his
feet; ‘sheriff, your prisoner. The captain’s off.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the instant the talesmen were forgotten, and
sheriff, deputies, tipstaves and freeholders turned
around, with open mouths and curious eyes. It was
a minute or more before the matter could be explained,
and by that time I saw that Slashbey had got
mounted. I shouted ‘stop thief’ at this, and sprang
out of the window, as if in pursuit, followed by the
sheriff and his constables, tumbling helter-skelter
over each other after me. The officers no sooner
caught sight of the fugitive than they roared lustily
to stop him, while the sheriff bawled for the ‘<span class='it'>posse
comitatus</span>’ like a bull of Bashan. It was no time to
respect property, so I followed the example of the
officers, and sprang on the first steed I came across,
eager to see the fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The court house stood nearly at the opposite end
of the village, from that out of which led the road to
Squankum, and when I mounted my horse, Slashbey
was scouring down the main street some hundred
yards ahead. Before a minute, however, the sheriff
and his pack were in full cry at the fugitive’s heels,
while as many of the spectators as could find horses
and vehicles started off, a few to aid the law, but
most to enjoy the sport. And, by my faith! what
a sight it was! Foremost in the chase gallopped the
sheriff, his hat off and his queue flying behind, bawling
himself red in the face by cries of ‘stop thief,’ ‘head
him off,’ ‘maintain the laws,’ amid the laughter of
some and the shouts of others of the crowd. At
every few leaps Slashbey would turn his face ruefully
around to see whether his pursuers gained on him or
not—reminding one of Tam O’Shanter, of blissful
memory, when he saw the witches yelling after him.
The captain would never have won the prize at Astley’s
for horsemanship, and now, what betwixt his
hurry and affright, he rode like a frightened monkey
at a circus. Gilpin did not create more excitement
in his famous race. The shopmen left their counters,
the blacksmith hurried from his forge, the school
children followed the pedagogue to the window, and
the very chanticleers, unwilling to let the hubbub go
by without they partook in it, flapped their wings on
the garden fences and crowed lustily. But with your
leave, I’ll pause to fill my glass, for a man telling a
story is like a steam-engine—he can’t get on without
he keeps the fire blazing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The race was now at its height. The uproar
was tremendous. Up flew the windows, and out
popped the heads. The women shrieked, the pigs
squealed, the men laughed, the boys cheered, and a
dozen curs hurried yelping and snapping at Thunderer’s
heels, who, alarmed at the hue and cry
around him, pricked up his ears, snorted, and fairly
taking the bit in his teeth, went off at a frantic pace.
You would have died with laughter had you seen
Slashbey then. Holding on to the rein with one hand,
he grasped the mane desperately with the other, and,
sticking his feet up to the heels in the stirrup, he
leaned forward until he lay almost prostrate on the
horse’s neck, while the tails of his coat flying up
behind disclosed the fair rotundity beneath, over
which his shining new buff cassimeres were stretched
as tight as a drum-head. At every leap he bounced
three feet from the saddle. The shouts of the <span class='it'>posse</span>
in his rear increased, while the captain’s rueful looks
behind became more frequent. Some cried ‘murder,’
others bawled ‘stop thief.’ The perspiration poured
down the captain’s cheeks. He gasped for breath.
And, to crown all, as he got opposite his charmer’s
dwelling, a puff of wind swept off his wig—for his
hat had been left in the court house in his hurry—and
the envied locks sailing away to the rear amid
convulsive shouts of laughter on the part of the crowd,
betrayed the bald pate of Slashbey glistening like
burnished silver in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Go it, fat ’un, and never mind the scratch,’ roared
a ragged spectator, who was fairly dancing with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hip—ho—heave ahead there,’ shouted another,
shieing a missile at the fugitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Whow—whow—whoa,’ halloed others, running
out in front of Thunderer and waving their arms and
hats before his eyes, but scampering hither and
thither as soon as the frightened steed drew near.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i025.jpg' alt='A man clings to a horse&#x27;s back while galloping wildly down a crowded street' id='iid-0003' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The captain felt his heart sink within him at this
accumulation of disasters, and he could scarcely summon
courage to look up, but he made a desperate
effort, and—oh! shades of the gallant tenth—there
was his mistress at the window pointing to his glossy
pate, and laughing until the tears ran out of her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The captain felt that his last hope was gone,
and in a moment of despair would have reined in his
horse, but Thunderer took the matter in his own
hands and kept on at a thrashing pace, amid the
shouts and pelting of the crowd. He dashed down
the cross-street, clattered over the bridge, and in a
few minutes crossed the brow of the neighboring hill
in a cloud of dust. The motley group in pursuit kept
on, but when Thunderer’s mettle was up there wasn’t
his match in the whole county, so that before long,
one after another of the <span class='it'>posse</span> drew in, leaving only
the sheriff and his deputies in pursuit. These, too,
gave out before they reached the vicinity of the
enchanted land, in other words, the cedar swamps
this side of Squankum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The joke clove to the captain’s name closer than
a brother. The little vixen of an heiress had all along
been coquetting with “the gallant warrior,” and now
she was the loudest among the laughers at her wigless
beau. She filled up Slashbey’s cup of sorrow by
marrying, shortly after, the gallant whose nose the
captain had pulled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What branch of the service,” asked a spooney
lieutenant from the bottom of the table, after the
laughter had somewhat subsided, “did you say your
friend belonged to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t particularize,” coolly said the narrator,
“but I believe it was the <span class='it'>flying</span> artillery.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SHIPWRECK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> arrival of our battered fleet in the Texal, was
the signal for a diplomatic war betwixt the ministers
of England, Holland and France. The result of this
encounter of wits, was the secret transfer of the captured
ships to the latter power, and an order from
the Prince of Orange to quit his dominions. Accordingly,
Paul Jones, having superseded Landais in
command of the Alliance, put to sea on the 27th of
December, 1779, and, after running the gauntlet of
the channel fleet, and approaching near enough to
the Downs to examine its force, reached the roads of
Groix on the 10th of February, 1780, in safety. As
these things are matters of history, I briefly pass
them over, the more readily because I did not myself
accompany the commodore; for having found a letter
from my captain, lying for me at Holland, requiring
my return to Paris, I seized the first opportunity and
started for France within a fortnight after the capture
of the Serapis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our run through the straits was pleasant, and we
had every prospect of a speedy voyage until our
second day out, when the wind freshened into a gale,
and before night it was blowing, as the old tars had
it, “great guns and marlinspikes.” Every thing,
however, was made fast and clean, and toward midnight
I sought my hammock, and in a few moments,
with a sailor’s carelessness, had forgotten our danger
in sleep. How long I slept I cannot tell, but I was
suddenly aroused from my slumbers by the heeling
of the ship, and as I started up in my berth, I heard
the salt water dashing through the cabin, and roaring
in the hold as if the bulk-heads were giving way.
The lights were out, and I could see nothing, but I
knew by the sound that the water was pouring in a
cataract down the companion way, and that all escape
therefore by that path was cut off. Could the
ship be sinking?—had she broached to?—where
were the crew? were the questions that rushed
through my mind at that awful moment. I listened
a second to hear, if I could, any sign of my fellow
passengers in the cabin; but the place appeared to
be deserted. Knowing that no time was to be lost,
I sprang to the window in the stern, but—Good God!
the dead lights were in, and all escape by that way
was closed on me. Louder and louder roared the
waters into the cabin, already they were dashing
their cold spray around me, and in a few seconds they
would submerge my berth. Death stared me in the
face—death, too, in its most horrid guise. My brain
whirled, my knees shook, my skin felt cold as the
grave, and my usually buoyant heart sank within me.
But these feelings triumphed only for a moment.
My native resolution came speedily to my aid, and I
determined to die, since die I must, like the old philosopher
who wrapped his garments around him and
lay down as if to a pleasant sleep. At this instant I
suddenly remembered that the cabin had an outlet
overhead, and groping my way along, half buried
in water the while, I caught hold of the frame work
of the binnacle, and dashing the glass out with my
hand, raised myself up, and, the next minute, crawled
on deck. For an instant—so terrific was the violence
of the gale which swept past me—I could neither
see, hear, nor stand. The rain and hail beating fiercely
against me, pinned me down to the spot which I had
first gained, while the thunder of the hurricane that
went whistling and roaring by, seemed to forebode
the approach of the final day itself. Oceans of water
deluged the deck, hissing past me like the scornful
laughter of fiends. At length I managed to raise my
head and cast a glance at the scene around me.
The darkness was almost impenetrable, but sufficient
light existed to convince me that the decks were deserted,
and that the ship was lying on her beam-ends,
with cataracts of water rolling momently over her
windward side. Oh! God, what a ruin! Officer and
man, passengers and crew, all, all had been swept
away by the devouring surge, and I alone was left,
preserved almost by a miracle. I gazed to leeward,
but only a waste of driving foam met my eye—I
looked astern, nothing but the green monsters of the
deep, rolling mountain high, were seen. At this instant
another deluge of foam whistled past, blinding
my eyes with spray, and jerking me with a giant’s
power from my hold. Buried in brine, bruised, despairing,
and almost stunned, I thought my hour had
come, and breathing a momentary prayer to heaven
for mercy, I resigned myself to death. Suddenly my
hand struck against something, which, with an instinctive
love for life, I grasped. My progress was instantaneously
checked, and, although the resistance
almost snapped my arms from their sockets, I still
clung to the object I had caught. When the billow
had whirled past, and the spray had ceased to blind
my eyes, I saw that I had seized one of the posts of
the bulwarks. Taking advantage of a momentary
lull, I crept to a place of greater security, and sat
down to ponder over my chances of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through that awful night I clung to my frail
support, expecting momently to be swept from it into
eternity. Language cannot describe my feelings.
No pen can paint the horrors of those long and dreary
hours. The air grew intensely cold: the rain became
hail. The sky, if possible, lowered more gloomily,
and the billows rolled higher and higher around me,
while the deep tones of the tempest mingled with the
chafing of the surges, rose up over all like the wild
choral symphony which we dream of as forever
rising from the world of ruin and despair. Borne
aloft on the waves, or hurried down into the abyss,
drenched, bruised, and bewildered, I saw no gleam
of hope. Beneath me was the boiling deep—above
me the sky seemed settling bodily down. Now the
gale whistled shrilly past, or now wailed moaningly
away to leeward. Darkness and terror were all
around me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the morning dawned, but slowly and despairingly.
The gale somewhat subsided, too; but
its violence was still terrific. In the eastern firmament
there was a dull, misty light, hanging like a
belt along the seaboard, but the sun itself was completely
obscured. By the faint glimmer thus thrown
around the scene, I hoped to distinguish some approaching
sail. It was in vain. Nothing met my
vision, save the wild waste tossing to and fro in agony.
Again and again I looked,—but again and again in
vain. At length I caught sight of what would have
seemed to a landsman to be the foam on the crest of
a far off wave, but which I knew to be a sail. How
my heart throbbed as I watched the course of the
approaching craft! I soon made her out to be a ship
driving before the gale under a close reefed main-course,
and as she approached nearer, I saw that she
was an English man-of-war. Captivity was better
than death, and I did not, therefore, hesitate. I
shouted aloud. But I might as well have lifted up
my voice against the thunder. I waved my arm
aloft. It was in vain. I clambered up on the weather-quarter,
and once more waving my arm, shouted with
superhuman strength. The head of the frigate came
gallantly around, and with a cry of joy, I saw the
man-of-war make towards me. Big tears of gratitude
rushed into my eyes, and my throat parched with
emotion. On came the noble stranger, swinging her
tall masts gracefully, and in a few minutes she was
close on to me. I could see the look-outs gazing
towards me. In a little space I should be rescued.
At this moment a billow broke over me again, but,
undaunted by the drenching, when I rose to the surface,
I turned gaily in the direction of the frigate.
God of my fathers!—she was not to be seen! I
gazed with a throbbing heart to windward, and there
was the man-of-war, edging away from me as if
unconscious of my presence. I gazed speechlessly
on her. The truth broke agonizingly on me. The
frigate had approached the wreck, and not seeing
me, had thought all on board lost, and resumed her
course. In vain I shouted, and in vain I waved my
arm frantically on high. I felt from the first there
was no hope, and at length, giving over every effort,
I crouched down once more in that state of complete
exhaustion, both mentally and physically, which
ensues, when the excitement of hope is followed by
the certainty of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day wore on. The tempest slowly abated.
Yet no welcome sail met my vision, unless a few far
off crafts which crossed the seaboard, hull down, and
which brought no hope, could be called welcome.
As hour after hour wore away, my hold on life grew
weaker and weaker. My physical powers, I felt,
could not much longer endure this exposure to tempest
and cold. Already the blood seemed at a stand
in my extremities, and I fancied I felt the cold chill
shuddering up to my heart. A drowsiness came over
me. But rallying myself, I beat my hands and
stamped my feet to invigorate, if possible, the vital
current. At length I paused from pure exhaustion.
Still no aid appeared. My spirits at length flagged.
I felt that utter prostration which, by taking away
the spring of hope, deprives us of all motive for
exertion, and is the sure forerunner of a death of
despair. I lost all longing for life. The sensation of
cold subsided. I felt no pain. A dreamy bliss crept
soothingly over my soul—the sea, the sky, the air,
the wreck swam around before me—visions such as
no mortal eye hath seen or imagined, thronged on
my brain—an exstacy I cannot describe, but which
makes my hand even now tremble with rapture, possessed
me,—and then all is blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, and I dreamed. I seemed to be in the centre
of a vast void, a universe of darkness and obscurity.
Yet all was not gloom. For amid the shadowy
firmament appeared a fair bright face beaming upon
me like an angel’s from the clouds—a face whose
features were written on my inmost heart, so soft
and seraphic was their expression! I knew it—it
was that of Beatrice. The mild blue eye, the hair
of wavy gold, the brow that rivalled a Madonna’s,
and more than all, the smile which now appeared all
glorified, told me that face was hers. And it gazed on
me with pity and love. And then I heard a voice—like
and yet unlike hers, for the tone was that of
Beatrice, but even sweeter, and, oh! how heavenly!
The very air seemed music. Was she, indeed, a
beatified spirit sent to waft me onward to a brighter
world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But once more all was dark—a voiceless void!
I had but one feeling, and that was of being. I knew
not, heard not, saw not. I could not think. But my
soul was, as it were, agony itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length a light broke in on that void. My brain
swam and I faintly opened my eyes. Was I yet an
inhabitant of earth? The bed, the curtains, the room
beyond convinced me at length that I lived. I feebly
raised myself up and gazed around. A footstep approached.
Overcome with faintness I sank down. A
hand put aside the curtains, a cry of joy broke from
the intruder, a hot tear-drop fell on my face. I looked
up, and there was Beatrice!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own—” I faintly articulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!—not a word yet,” she said archly, placing
her fingers to her lips with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> a hot sultry afternoon, in the August of 18—,
a tall, pale, melancholy-looking gentleman alighted
from the stage-coach at the door of the Eagle Tavern,
in Buffalo, and, after a few minutes’ conversation
with the bar-keeper, was ushered into a handsome
private parlor, while his baggage was carried to one
of the finest bed-rooms in the house. Perhaps, had
the stranger mingled carelessly with the loungers on
the piazza, after his arrival, he would have attracted
little more attention than the companions of his wearisome
journey, for, excepting a slight moustache on
his upper lip, there was nothing to distinguish him in
external appearance. But his quiet, grave deportment,
and the desire for seclusion which he exhibited,
excited the curiosity of the news-mongers, and a
thousand conjectures concerning him were immediately
set afloat. The stranger, however, seemed little
disposed to satisfy the spirit of inquiry which
prevails so extensively in American hotels; for, after
taking possession of his apartments, he appeared no
more that evening, and the waiter, who carried to
him his supper, could only say that “he was a <span class='it'>real</span>
gentleman, for he had given him a hard dollar—that
he wore a flowered silk dressing-gown and embroidered
slippers, and that he was going to stay in Buffalo
a month.” The next morning the interest which
he had excited extended itself to the no less curious
gossips of the gentler sex; and, when the bell rang
for dinner, many an eye was turned to the closed door
of Room No. 2, in the hope of seeing its inmate
emerge from his retirement. They were not doomed
to disappointment. After all were seated at table,
the stranger glided quietly into the dining-hall, and
took his seat at the foot of the well-filled board, apparently
unconscious of the piercing glances which
were directed towards him. Notwithstanding the
profusion of dainties which were officiously offered
him by the waiter, whose heart had been won by the
“hard dollar” on the previous night, he merely tasted
a single dish, and refusing all the luxuries of the dessert,
finished his frugal meal with a bit of dry bread
and a glass of iced water. His abstemiousness and
abstraction of manner excited the attention of every
one, and when he silently rose to leave the table,
many a glance followed his slowly-receding form.
The ladies had not failed to observe his stately figure,
his fine aquiline nose, the melancholy softness of his
dark eyes, and the beauty of his hands, which were
small, white and tapering, as, according to Napoleon
and Byron, all aristocratic hands should be. They
at once decided that he was a person of some distinction;
perhaps an English nobleman incognito, or
at least a rich and well-born Southerner. But a week
had elapsed before he chose to give any other idea of
his rank and station than might be derived from the
register of the hotel, where he had inscribed, in a
very elegant hand, the name of “Charles Stuart
Montague, New Orleans.” Polite, courteous and
gentlemanly to every one whom he chanced to encounter,
particularly to females, he soon won the
suffrages of all by his civilities, while he excited
general sympathy by his uniform sadness of deportment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the inmates of the house was the Hon. Mr.
Windlespin, an extensive land-holder and an ex-member
of Congress, who, with his two daughters, had
recently returned from a visit to France, and now occupied
elegantly-furnished apartments in the hotel.
The saloon appropriated to this family was directly
opposite to that occupied by Mr. Montague, and the
ladies were dying with curiosity to learn something
about their handsome neighbor. The heat of the
weather compelled both to leave open the doors of
their respective apartments, and the many furtive
looks which the two Misses Windlespin cast into the
tempting room had enabled them to catch a glimpse
of a richly-enchased writing-case upon the centre
table, and a guitar leaning against the chimney-piece,
while they had several times enjoyed the opportunity
of watching the solemn step of the melancholy stranger,
as, attired in the said silk dressing-gown, he
paced the limits of his apartment. They reflected
much upon the singular mystery which seemed to involve
him. What could make him so unhappy? He
was evidently rich, handsome, and, as they were
willing to believe, accomplished—for the mournful
strains of a flute were sometimes heard at the dim
twilight, and occasionally a few chords on the guitar,
struck as if with a trembling hand, resounded through
his lonely room. What could be the cause of such
deep despondency?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Montague had not been quite insensible to
the vicinity of the elegant Misses Windlespin. A
graceful bow had frequently marked his consciousness
of their presence as he passed the open door of
the parlor; and, more than once, he had paused at
the entrance of the dining-hall, while they swept by
to take their places at table, acknowledging his politeness
by a profound courtesy <span class='it'>à la mode de Paris</span>.
In the course of the changes which daily occur at a
public table, Mr. Montague had gradually moved up,
until, as one of the oldest boarders in the house, he
occupied a seat next to the Windlespin family. A
fine opportunity was now offered for those civilities
which cost so little and are often productive of so
many pleasant results. By degrees the abstraction
of the melancholy gentleman was beguiled by the
charms of his fair neighbors, and the ladies noticed,
with no small degree of satisfaction, that they could
induce him, not only to prolong his stay at table, but
also to exchange his frugal fare for the dainties which
they so much enjoyed. In short, an acquaintance
between them had fairly commenced, and they mutually
congratulated each other when the “<span class='it'>interesting
stranger</span>” actually accepted an invitation to pass
an evening with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Grace Windlespin was a sentimentalist, while
her sister Catharine affected vivacity and brilliancy.
The elder was all poetry—the younger all fun and
frolic. Grace spoke in a gentle voice, and raised her
blue eyes sweetly and languidly to the face of those
whom she addressed; while Kate (for so, in imitation
of Shakspeare’s heroine, she affected to be
styled) turned the full light of her bold laughing
glances on every one worth looking at. The one delighted
in the soft pleasures of sensibility—the other
in the ready repartee and saucy jest. In short, the
sisters were alike in nothing except their excessive
affectation. Neither of them exhibited her natural
character; all was assumed for effect, and each had
studied the part best suited to her style of beauty.
The slightly-bending figure, pale complexion and long
chestnut ringlets of Grace were admirably suited to
her very <span class='it'>poetic</span> manner; while the blonde hair, rosy
cheeks and somewhat dumpy person of her merry
sister were equally well suited to the devil-may-care
character which she chose to assume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their father was one of those kind of persons who
are constantly engaged in visionary schemes of
wealth. Nobody better understood how to puff up a
bubble—nobody was better skilled in “mapping
out” landed estates—nobody possessed in such perfection
the gift of “<span class='it'>fortune-telling</span>” as the Hon. Mr.
Windlespin. Originally a country shop-keeper in
Jersey, his first start in life had been rather an odd
one. Taking advantage of the mania for “real estate
speculations,” which pervaded the whole country,
he, in company with several others, projected a
new city, to be located upon their extensive and
somewhat barren farms. Accordingly a large hotel
was built, a meeting-house erected, a school-house
raised, and some half dozen dwelling-houses were
ranged along what was meant to be the main street.
In an incredibly short time all was completed, and
every thing was ready except the people who were
required to occupy the infant city. These were still
to be found, and the company began to discover that
it would be exceedingly inconvenient to pay “<span class='it'>interest
monies</span>” without some assistance. At this juncture
the genius of Mr. Windlespin devised an expedient
for bringing their new settlement into notice.
He advertised in all the papers that a purse of fifty
dollars would be “<span class='it'>danced for</span>” by twelve <span class='it'>Communipaw
negroes</span>—the dancers to be selected from as
many as chose to try their skill previous to the grand
effort. The scene of these new <span class='it'>Athletæ</span> was to be
the extensive plain which fronted the hotel at “<span class='it'>Scipio-Africanus</span>”—for
such was the sounding title
which Mr. Windlespin, after a careful search into an
old copy of Lemprière’s dictionary, had chosen for
the incipient city. The idle, the dissolute, and the
shiftless—the people who are most easily led to
change their habitations, like wandering Arabs, are
the very men who were most likely to be attracted
by such a queer and novel amusement. Accordingly
Mr. Windlespin’s plan succeeded admirably. On the
day appointed for the selection of the sable candidates
for <span class='it'>saltatory honors</span>, several hundred people
were assembled in and about the hotel, while a still
greater number of the dark race were gathered to
exhibit their skill. Certain rules were laid down for
the governance of the assembly—a place was cleared
for the exhibition—the negroes came forward by
tens, and he who could tire down all his companions
was set aside as worthy to compete for the prize.
The first day was consumed in this important investigation;
<span class='it'>thirty</span> first-rate professors of the double-shuffle
and heel-and-toe exercise had been chosen,
and the following day was to be devoted to the selection
of the appointed <span class='it'>twelve</span>, from this reduced number
of candidates. The hotel was filled to overflowing—the
dwelling houses were no longer empty
shells; but, furnished with camp beds, offered shelter
and repose to the wearied spectators, and even
the meeting-house was appropriated to their accommodation.
The second day was similarly spent, except
that the concourse of visiters had increased, and
the excitement of the scene had produced sundry
brawls and broken heads. The third and last day
was appropriated to the performance of the selected
twelve, and the final adjudication of the purse. Never
had there been such gyrations, such circumflexions,
such saltations as were then witnessed. Never had
a victory been purchased at such a sudoriferous expense.
One after another, the dancers withdrew exhausted,
until only three were left, who seemed to
bid defiance to fatigue. Hour after hour they continued
their exertions, until they seemed to be converted
into mere machines, and with staring eyes,
stiffened limbs, and shining faces, appeared like monstrous
images, moved by some mechanical force. At
last the spectators became completely tired with this
exhibition of perpetual motion. They insisted that
the prize should be equally divided between the three
indefatigable dancers, and thus the singular entertainment
closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Windlespin had not been idle during those
three days. His brandy was very excellent—he
made “glorious” rum punch—his cigars were real
“Habanas,” and his customers had fully enjoyed the
manifold creature comforts which he offered them.
When they prepared to return home, most of them
carried in their pockets the deed of a building-lot in
the town of Scipio-Africanus, for which they had
paid ten per cent. of the purchase-money, and given
a bond and mortgage for the remainder; while a few,
being persuaded that the neighborhood of such a hotel
was a most desirable addition to the comforts of
a family, concluded to take immediate possession of
the houses already erected. Thus did the incipient
city receive its earliest inhabitants, and though it
has never yet been obliged to enlarge its borders in
consequence of <span class='it'>over-populousness</span>, it still drags on a
sickly existence, having, however, exchanged its original
euphonious title for the more simple but no less
expressive one of “<span class='it'>Niggertown</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Windlespin’s grand stroke of policy remained
yet to be shown. As treasurer of the company, as
well as officiating master of the hotel, all monies
derived from the custom at the bar, as well as from
the sale of building-lots, had passed through his
hands. After the affair was over, he called a meeting
of the company, exhibited a statement of expenses
and receipts, and after deducting the former,
paid over the latter to the various members, reserving
to himself a handsome commission for his trouble.
He did not think it necessary to inform his
confederates of the fact that every thing had been
purchased on credit, and that, so far from paying the
expenses, he had, by using their names, rendered
them liable for the debt which had been incurred, but
quietly pocketing the lion’s share of the spoils, he
bade adieu to the limits of “Niggertown,” in order
to try his luck in a new field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was Mr. Windlespin’s first essay in fortune-hunting,
and several affairs of a similar nature had
so increased his means, that he found himself quite
a respected resident in one of our northern cities, almost
before he was aware of his elevated position in
society. He was finally chosen a member of congress
for the district, and though, owing to some dubious
transaction, his seat was disputed, and he magnanimously
resigned what he knew he could not keep,
yet he never relinquished the prefix of Honorable, to
which the choice of his constituents entitled him.
Shortly before the appearance of Mr. Charles Stuart
Montague upon the scene, Mr. Windlespin had taken
his daughters to Paris, where they received the benefit
of foreign polish for six weeks, and then returned
as highly accomplished as a modern boarding-school,
a journey in a French diligence and a taste of French
cookery could make them. They meant to marry,
and to marry rich, and therefore each had chosen a
part which, while it offered a wide field, was likely,
as they supposed, to occasion no rivalry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Windlespin was too wily to be long in doubt
as to Mr. Montague’s circumstances. He managed
to discover that he was a widower, sorrowing over
the recent loss of a beloved wife, and that he had
come to the north with the double motive of dissipating
his grief, and purchasing a certain description
of merchandise, which he designed to send to the
city of Galveston, where a branch of his widely-extended
commercial house was established. This
news was of course communicated to the young ladies,
and while Grace became doubly sentimental,
Kate, the amiable romp, determined to wile him from
his vain regrets by the charms of gayety. Leaving
his daughters to pursue their matrimonial plans, Mr.
Windlespin determined to make the most of his present
opportunities, and, if possible, to gain some percentage
on account of the interesting stranger. He
accordingly sounded a friend, a careful old Scotchman,
who dealt largely in the kind of goods required
by Mr. Montague, and endeavored to secure a handsome
commission from him, in case he brought him
so profitable a customer. But the crafty old fellow
was not to be caught with fair promises; he required
proof of Mr. Montague’s ability to become a cash
customer, and accepted an invitation to meet him at
Mr. Windlespin’s apartments. But the scene which
met his eyes when he entered the parlor at early
twilight, was not calculated to give him a very exalted
opinion of his anticipated dealer. The elegant
Mr. Montague, attired in pantaloons of spotless
white, with gaiters of the same snowy hue, extending
within an inch of the toe of his shining boot—a
blue silk fancy jacket, fastened to his waist by a
sash of crimson net—an embroidered collar, turned
back from his throat, and embroidered ruffles dangling
over his delicate hands, seemed to the rough
old borderer like the very personification of effeminacy
and folly. But when he only half rose from his
graceful attitude, and extended the tip of his finger
to the visiter, while he directly turned from him to
continue his flirtation with the sisters, Mr. MacDonald
lost all patience with himself for having been
foolish enough to expect any benefit from such a
“popinjay.” But even Mr. MacDonald could not
read the character of the “interesting stranger.”
Early on the following morning, he had scarcely
reached the counting-room, when he was surprised
by a visit from Mr. Montague, and the old man could
scarcely identify the hero of the past evening’s manœuvres
in the keen and practised man of business
who now addressed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never talk on business in the presence of ladies,
sir,” said the elegant gentleman, “and this, I hope,
will account for my silence on the subject last evening;
if I am rightly informed, however, you are the
very person to whom I was advised to apply by my
friend Mr. Tickler, of New Orleans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Mr. Tickler, cashier of the Sugarcane Bank,
you mean; an old friend of mine,” answered Mr.
MacDonald, “did he give you letters to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” answered Mr. Montague; “when I left
New Orleans, I was not certain whether I should visit
Buffalo, or limit my journey to New York, and therefore
I brought no letters to any one in this city. However,
you probably know your friend’s hand-writing,
and, if so, these papers will answer our purpose better
than a mere empty introduction.” With these
words he drew from his pocket-book sundry certificates
of deposit in the Sugarcane Bank, which bore
the signature of the cashier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is his hand, sure enough, and a crabbed fist
he writes too,” said Mr. MacDonald, after a close
scrutiny of the proffered papers. While examining
the signatures, the careful old man had not forgotten
to glance at the amounts, and he thus learned that
the sum of <span class='it'>thirty thousand dollars</span> was at that moment
lying in the Sugarcane Bank to the credit of
Mr. Charles Stuart Montague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am desirous of purchasing some twenty or
thirty thousand dollars worth of goods,” said the
gentleman, carelessly, “and if I can get them sufficiently
cheap here to pay the cost of transportation
to New York, I would rather buy in Buffalo than
hunt among the Pearl street jobbers in that Babel of
a city. I mean to pay cash, and shall ship the goods
immediately to Galveston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an immense business those southern merchants
must do,” mentally exclaimed Mr. MacDonald;
“he speaks of dollars as if they were pebbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Montague continued: “If you are disposed to
let me have the specified articles at fair prices, with
a liberal discount for cash, I will immediately make
arrangements to have them sent on. However,” he
added, noticing the cautious Scotchman’s hesitation,
“perhaps you had better take till to-morrow to think
about it, and, in the mean time, I will look round the
market, and may possibly be able to find better bargains
than you can afford me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang the fellow’s boldness,” thought Mr. MacDonald;
“if he were a rogue he would not be so indifferent
about the matter.” He determined, however,
to consult Mr. Windlespin before he made his
decision, and therefore fixed upon the following day
to settle the affair. Mr. Windlespin took the opportunity
offered by Mr. Montague’s daily visit to his
daughters, and in the course of a private interview
with the merchant, entered into a negotiation with
him by which he, Mr. Windlespin, bound himself to
take half the risk, on condition of receiving half the
profits of the sales made to Mr. Montague. Mr. MacDonald
preferred this method to the original proposition
of a certain percentage, as it gave him the opportunity
of gaining an advantage over both the parties.
Accordingly Mr. Montague was waited upon
by Mr. MacDonald, and a close and hair-splitting
negotiation was carried on for some time, which resulted
in the purchase of goods to the value of twenty
thousand dollars, which were to be delivered to Mr.
Montague’s agent in New York free of all expenses.
In return, Mr. Montague handed to Mr. MacDonald
certificates of deposit to the amount of twenty-five
thousand dollars, which were easily negotiable in
New York at three per cent. discount; and as some
time would be required to complete the transaction,
the stranger agreed to prolong his stay in Buffalo
until the delivery of the goods in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile, the elegant widower was managing
equally well in his love affairs. He listened
to Kate’s wild sallies with a languid smile, and patted
her round cheek or clasped her luxuriant waist in
a most brother-like or rather <span class='it'>cousin-like</span> fashion. To
Grace he was all courtliness and gentleness; if he
took her hand it was with an air of timid respect,
which would have done honour to a “<span class='it'>Paladin chivalresque</span>,”
and if he ventured to hang over her, as
she sat in one of her sentimental attitudes, it was
with a look of tender melancholy which melted her
very heart. Each believed herself the favorite.
Kate could draw him from his trance of grief, and
Grace was allowed to sympathise with him. He
talked to one of the gayeties of New Orleans—to
the other, of the domestic happiness he had enjoyed
there; and when, at length, he was induced to exercise
his musical talents in their behalf, he played
fandangos on the guitar for the lovely Kate, while he
poured forth the mournful voice of the wailing flute
for her sentimental sister. But, notwithstanding all
her exquisite sensibility, Grace Windlespin beheld
with secret satisfaction the returning cheerfulness of
the bereaved widower. He talked less of departed
joys, and seemed less despairing of future peace.
The miniature of his lost wife was no longer pressed
to his lips with all the fondness of passionate love
whenever his feelings were overpowered by tender
recollections, and, though he still wore it about his
neck, it was suspended upon a <span class='it'>hair chain</span>, the gift of
the gentle Grace, and <span class='it'>presumed</span> to be a tress from her
own chestnut locks, though in reality derived from
the store of a fashionable barber in the neighborhood.
His watch-guard was braided by the hands of the
lovely hoyden who had laughingly promised him her
garter for the purpose; and, in short, each had reason
to suppose herself the true magnet of attraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But matters were now drawing to a crisis. The
goods were now sent on to New York, and Mr. Montague
received tidings that they had been duly received
by his agent. The certificates of deposit were
negotiated by two of the Wall street brokers, and
Mr. MacDonald, after paying himself, handed to the
young southerner the balance. It became necessary,
therefore, for Mr. Montague to repair to New York,
in order to superintend the shipment of his merchandise,
and he felt himself obliged to settle his “<span class='it'>affaire
du cœur</span>” before his departure.</p>

<p class='noindent'>sung the “interesting stranger,” as he reflected upon
his position between the rival beauties. But he
managed with his usual adroitness. The gentle
Grace contrived to secure an uninterrupted interview
with him, and received a proffer of his heart and
hand, both of which gifts she lovingly accepted, together
with a delicate locket, containing some of her
adorer’s raven hair, set in a circlet of aqua-marine
gems—“emblems,” as he said, “of her transparent
guilelessness of character.” A merry game of romps
with Kate afforded him a chance of whispering a declaration
in her ear also, and an elegant diamond
ring, “only less brilliant than her own bright eyes”—to
use his elegant phrase—was received by her as a
pledge of betrothment to Mr. Charles Stuart Montague.
Having arranged these little matters to his
satisfaction, he departed, leaving his flute, his guitar,
and his writing-case, in charge of the ladies until
his return. Meanwhile the sisters—each imagining
she had outwitted the other—kept their own
secret, and patiently awaited the moment when the
lover should return to claim his bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely a month had elapsed, however, when intelligence
of a most startling nature was received.
The certificates of deposit, which had been forwarded
by the New York brokers to their agents in New
Orleans, when presented to the bank for payment,
were pronounced to be <span class='it'>forgeries</span>! An inquiry was
immediately instituted respecting Mr. Charles Stuart
Montague, and the result of the investigation was,
that no such person was known to the cashier of the
Sugarcane Bank, and that the signatures to the certificates,
though admirably well executed, were only
<span class='it'>excellent imitations</span> of the rugged characters in which
Mr. Tickler usually traced his name. But the length
of time which was required to ascertain that fact, had
afforded the gentleman full time to complete his
plans. The goods which he had purchased in Buffalo,
had been sold at auction by his confederate, as
soon as they reached New York. Mr. Montague arrived
there in time to divide the spoils; and, instead
of shipping the merchandise, they concluded to ship
<span class='it'>themselves</span> for Texas; while Mr. Windlespin and Mr.
MacDonald, who had endorsed the certificates, were
left to reimburse the brokers, and to pocket their
own loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies were filled with amazement and grief,
and, in the first overwhelming burst of anguish, revealed
to each other the alarming fact that Mr. Montague
was actually <span class='it'>engaged to marry both</span>! His
writing-case was opened, and found to contain some
rose-tinted note paper—a stick of pink sealing-wax,
and an agate seal, with the impressive motto, “<span class='it'>toujours
fidèle</span>.” But, upon further examination, a private
drawer was discovered, containing the following
letters:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Jack</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the deuce don’t you get on faster with
your Buffalo scheme? It will cost as much as it is
worth if you stay much longer. I believe you like
the trade of gentleman, for whenever you take it up
you let every thing else hang by the eyelids till you
get into some scrape which drives you ahead. What
do you expect to gain by courting those two girls
when you can’t marry either of them if they were as
rich as Jews? For my part I don’t see the use of playing
the devil when there is nothing to be gained by it.

<p class='pindent'>The enclosure was still more curious:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>About two years after the events just recorded,
Miss Grace Windlespin (who had long since discovered
that her aqua-marine locket, like her sister’s
diamond, was as false as the lover’s heart) was led
to the hymeneal altar, as the phrase is, by a very respectable
<span class='it'>tailor</span>; while Miss Kate had tamed down
her wild spirit so far as to marry a country school-master—an
elderly widower, with several children.
The truth was that Mr. Windlespin’s land speculations
had ended in total ruin, and the ladies had no
time to pick and choose among their admirers, when
they daily feared the exposure of their actual circumstances.
They were married with great parade, however,
and immediately after the ceremony the happy
couples set off on a bridal tour—the two husbands
having no doubt that the father’s wedding gift would
pay all such little extra expenses. Among the places
of note which they visited was the famous Auburn
prison. The time chosen was the hour when the inmates
are usually led out to dinner, and the ladies
stood quietly regarding the gangs of men, who, with
folded arms and locked step, moved forward, as if
with a single impulse, like some complicated machine.
Suddenly Grace uttered a loud shriek, and
threw herself tenderly on her husband’s bosom. One
of the prisoners had dared to look at her as he passed,
and, unobserved by his keeper, had even given her a
knowing <span class='it'>wink</span>. Kate kept her own counsel about it,
and did not appear to notice the insolent look of the
handsome felon; but, notwithstanding his shaven
head and prison garb, she, as well as Grace, had recognised
the features of “the interesting stranger”—the
elegant Mr. Charles Stuart Montague—alias—Jack
Mugson, the swindler!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Shakspeare</span> should be read at least once a year.
This is to the mind what an excursion in the country
is to the body—a strengthening, health-producing
process. Each perusal will not be a repetition of the
preceding. On the contrary, no two perusals will
ever be alike. Read him as <span class='it'>a boy</span>, you will be dazzled
and delighted: read him year by year after, and
you will, with each year, behold beauties, sealed to
you before, from your own comparative narrowness
of mind and want of experience. Each event of your
life will render you fitter to study him. Each new
acquaintance you form—each history you read—each
science you study—each country you travel
into—each step you advance in life—each friend
you lose by treachery or death, will prepare you still
further. Could you go on adding to your experience
much more than has ever (except in Shakspeare’s
own case) been added to that of mortal man, each
new progress would still enlarge your capacity for
appreciating him. All men comprehend him differently.
The king reads him as he would listen to the
princely counsels of a royal father. The beggar may
find in him something applicable to himself, and
something likely to make him happier and wiser,
which he himself had before never thought of—or
of which he had only formed a vague idea. The
statesman—the general—the prince royal—the
husband—the father—the wife—the lover—the
unfortunate—the happy—may all come here, and
carry away, from the boundless reservoir, something
apparently intended for themselves. He seems to
have described or alluded <span class='it'>to every thing</span>. He seems
to have taken in the whole range of human nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor <span class='it'>old general Montholon</span>, who was with Napoleon
at St. Helena—one of the most faithful of the
friends who have adhered to the fallen family—is
the companion of the Prince Louis Napoleon, in his
late <span class='it'>invasion</span> of France. Nearly all were very young
men. This white-headed old soldier appeared among
them strangely. Had they succeeded, it was doubtless
their hope to give respectability to their cause
by his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not going to reprint the beauties of Shakspeare.
Instances like the above—<span class='it'>a case</span>—an
event—a feature of human nature—are so common
that they need not be pointed out. Thousands of
years hence, as the numberless crowd of unexpected
events come on, it will be found that this poet has
already described them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts occurred to me the other evening
after taking up casually a volume of Macbeth—perhaps
one of the most tremendous portraitures of human
nature that ever came from the pen of man.
The play opened by chance to the scene where the
remorse-haunted queen walks in her sleep. Surely
no human writer ever set down, in the same number
of words, a more terrific picture. It has upon me
almost the effect ascribed to Medusa’s head. It
nearly turns me to stone. We know that but few of
the great Greek tragedies have descended to the
modern reader, but neither in them, nor in any of the
ancient or modern writers, is there a scene more
highly conceived, more perfectly executed, or acting
with more power upon the heart and the imagination.
I have not read any comments or commentators,
German or English, respecting it, and therefore very
probably may omit some of its peculiarities. I think
it <span class='it'>the</span> scene of Macbeth, the climax and moral of the
tragedy, and perhaps the finest and most extraordinary
piece of writing in the whole of the author’s
works. No where in the range of literature is there
to be seen such a frightful fragment of human nature.
I can never read it without feeling the blood grow
cold in my veins, and receiving a most painful heart-sick
impression of the evils which hang over the
mortal state, when not protected by moral and religious
principle; and I can perfectly understand an
anecdote related of Mrs. Siddons, who, on attempting
to study the part alone in her room at night, became
so frightened that she called her maid as a
companion. Perhaps the Shaksperian theorist, who
has discovered that the purpose of our poet’s works
was to make an illustration of the truth of Christianity,
by putting within every man’s, every boy’s
reach the whole compass of experience to be derived
from a hundred eventful lives, had an eye upon this
scene among others. It certainly has to me a profound
metaphysical and religious meaning, and is best
explained by supposing it, like Othello, a gigantic
enigma, of which Christianity is the solution. To
represent human nature thus, without offering any
remedial or softening consideration, was not characteristic
of the sweet, gentle and sunshiny imagination
of the poet. His whole works, taken together,
do not leave any such shadow on the imagination.
He is no misanthrope—no infidel. He points with
his wand to human nature as she is, unguided, unsustained,
unprotected by the Supreme Power. He
draws the blood-stained yet heart-crushed queen, not
to appal us with a danger to which we are subject,
but to point out one which we can avoid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is not <span class='it'>a single word</span> of this scene which can
be spared—not one which is not impregnated with
blood and horror. You feel the very silence of the
sick, midnight apartment. Ye see the pale ashy
countenance of the terror-stricken gentlewoman, and
sympathize with her in having her lot cast in such an
abode of guilt and danger. You see that she has
called up all her energy and presence of mind, as in
a great crisis, to enable her to conduct herself wisely,
and to escape with safety from this den of royal murderers.
You can see her cautious step—as if she
started even at the creaking of her own shoe—the
rustling of her own robe, or the sighing of the wind
around the distant turrets of the castle. You have
here a most admirable character, and, except that
she is but so short a time on the stage, almost as
worthy the genius of Mrs. Siddons as that of Lady
Macbeth herself. Were I a young actress, desirous
of making my appearance before the public, I should
choose to study thoroughly and represent well this
character first,—a very great effect might be given
to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor is also done to the life. He is, in all
respects, not only the medical man, but the medical
man of coolness and experience. The few words he
utters are full of curiosity, but not of the unbridled
horror of his companion. He has doubtless, before,
witnessed scenes enough of pain and anguish, and he
is at first disposed to consider the gentlewoman as
an exaggerator of the mysteries she professes to have
beheld, and to treat the whole thing physically as a
disease, till the truth becomes too apparent, and even
his cool mind is convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Macbeth herself is the very <span class='it'>ne plus ultra</span> of
the tragic. She has more terror in her step and eye,
than a mere mortal ever had before. Waking remorse
would not have been, by any means, so appalling.
The fact of her being asleep is a great accessory.
That pale face—those fixed, staring, dead
eyes—the countenance emaciated by disease, and
the long consuming fire of conscience—the step,
solemn, slow, measured and unearthly—and the
dark, dim and shifting imagery of the past, which
floats to and fro through her imagination, form altogether
a spectacle shocking and almost insupportable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us take this extraordinary scene to pieces, and
examine a little into its mechanism. One of the
wonders of it is that there is no resort to <span class='it'>style</span>—no
description—no bursts of eloquence—no lava-like
eruption of passions. There are indeed but very few
words said at all. The sick lady has, at first, no terrors
for the doctor, and the gentlewoman has often
beheld the same thing before. There is no stage effect—no
management—no melo-dramatic cunning.
The doctor even shows his coolness and incredulity,
and makes a careless general remark. The transcendant
genius of the poet felt, intuitively, that the
situation of his characters here was so complete as
to absorb the reader, and render unnecessary any but
the simplest language. The whole scene is quiet,
hushed and professional. Even the blank verse of
the rest of the tragedy is laid aside, and the characters
speak in common-place perfectly natural prose.
Let us see what this almost supernatural terror consists
in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor first says, we may suppose with a certain
half unintentional degree of disappointment, that
he has been already watching two nights to see something
which the waiting-woman has reported to him
respecting the queen, and yet he has seen nothing.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
no truth in your report.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A little impatient, a little incredulous, perhaps,
he adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“When was it she last walked?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a stroke of nature and probability at the
very outset. It takes from the scene the air of a fiction.
It sends the mind of the spectator back to the
two past long nights, when the doctor, tolerably tired
out, has been watching in vain. This is just as things
happen in life. We have to watch and watch for
every thing—even for the most true—before it appears.
We feel also, even with the first apparently
unimportant word spoken, a certain tremor at the
intimation given of the domestic gloom which must
reign in the royal household—an attack immediately
expected from a powerful and inexorable foe—the
queen sick—mysterious things, we know not what,
hinted with pale face and trembling lips—and the
guilty being, who had sold her eternal soul for her
present position,—we see her <span class='it'>in</span> that position, all
the promised triumphs and pleasures neutralized by
disease and remorse, and she herself <span class='it'>watched</span> by her
servants, night after night, when she little dreams
herself the subject of such a combined inquisition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentlewoman relates more particularly what
she has seen, though with a guarded care, which not
every gentlewoman in real life, under such exciting
circumstances, would have the prudence to observe;
but Shakspeare’s people are not only living but very
sensible persons. To the question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“When was it she last walked?”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>she replies:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Since his majesty went into the field.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Here at once is another stroke. It tells the <span class='it'>occupation</span>
of the king; called to a fearful contest and absorbed
in it, the deadly secret is transpiring unopposed,
undreamed of by him, behind his back, in the
centre of his household, and from the lips of the very
being who has so often taunted his weakness, and
urged him with haughty scorn onward in his guilty
and blood-tracked career. So little power has man
over destiny! Thus is guilt beset. These are the
nameless, unimaginable dangers it runs, when, bold
and self-confident, it thinks itself equal to a contest
with the Deity, who, seated in the clouds, strikes it
with its own arm, and baffles its plans with the toils
it has woven for others.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her
rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock
her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon it, read it,
afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while
in a most fast sleep.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing more appalling to me than a person
walking in his sleep. It is such an image of
death aroused from the grave—such a type of the
spiritual world—such a contrast to the same being
when awake, that I could never look upon my most
intimate friend in such a state without a thrill of fear,
as if I were gazing upon his spectre—without perfectly
comprehending Hamlet’s account of his own
feelings in looking upon a ghost.</p>

<p class='line0'>——“and we fools of nature</p>

<p class='line0'>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This statement of the waiting-woman, so simple,
natural and true, is enough to arouse in a moment the
curiosity of the most indifferent stranger, and to inspire
him with an inexpressible anxiety to know what
it means, and to what it will lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor, however, is a man of the world, and
is not so easily worked on. He replies with a mere
generality:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“A great perturbation in nature! to receive at once the
benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching. In this
slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other actual performances,
what at any time have you heard her say?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here there is a peeping out of curiosity on the part
of the honest physician, who is eager to learn all that
may be acquired of what has the appearance of an
interesting secret. But his companion does not mean
to go further than prudence and self-security require.
She replies at once in a way which, while it balks
curiosity, sharpens its appetite.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“That, sir, which I will not report after her.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>What would any doctor say in such a case?</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“You may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He is aroused. He wishes—he is determined to
know this mystery, and therefore pleads the privilege
and necessity, as well as the prudence of his
profession. “You may tell <span class='it'>any</span> thing to <span class='it'>me</span>. Of
course I shall never reveal. I am the depositary of a
thousand family secrets. Besides, if I am to treat
the patient, I <span class='it'>must</span> know what is the matter with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the waiting-woman is not going to be driven
from her determination. She has obviously received
<span class='it'>a deep-seated fright</span>. Her whole self-possession is
called up for her defence and guidance. She is a single
woman, in a lonely castle, and in a really awful
position, accidentally the holder of a secret involving
the reputation, if not the life and death of those in
power, and the fate perhaps of nations. Were she to
hint her suspicion that her royal mistress was a murderess—that
the fierce king, now desperate with the
danger impending over his kingdom, had gained the
throne by a foul assassination—how can she be sure
that the doctor will not go to the king and betray
her, to ingratiate himself into the favor of his royal
master? Courts are not the places for too light confidences—particularly
of such secrets. In such case
the truth or falsehood of the statement would be little
inquired into, and she would be probably hurled from
the battlements or immured to starve in some dark
dungeon. She is—you feel she is, quite in earnest,
and quite right to reply:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A LEGEND OF ST. MARY’S.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. MARY M. FORD.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> the eastern bank of a small river, which enters
the Potomac a few miles above its confluence with
the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, are still to be
seen vestiges of the earliest settlement in Maryland;
once the village of Youcómaco, but quietly yielded
by the natives to the white colonists, who there built
a town, calling it St. Mary’s. Subsequent events led
to its desertion for a more advantageous location, and
the ravages of time have left little to tell of its former
state. It has faded away, unnoticed and unsung, yet
its name is still seen on the older maps of our country.
The river, which once bore the appellation of St.
George’s, is now called St. Mary’s, but whether in
memory of the deserted town, or not, is uncertain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruins are happily so scarce in our young and
thriving republic, that the simple legend which gives
a name to my story, may awaken some interest among
those, to whose imaginations the solitary remains of
the past seem to speak in the breathings of the winds
that sweep over their ruins. The circumstances
which led to its narration, by one who had heard it
in the mother country, and in whose family its
memory had been handed down, were as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many years ago, as the last lingering sunbeams
were fading from the sky, giving place to the mellow
twilight; and a ruddy tinge was on the bosom of the
waters, where the little river of St. Mary’s mingled
its tributary stream with the waves of the broad
Potomac; a small vessel had just anchored within
the mouth of the former river, on which is established
a port of entry. The craft seemed awaiting the boarding
officer, who, at a point further up the river, was
just entering his boat. He appeared very young, and,
from the open gaiety of his fine countenance, seemed
to enjoy corresponding lightness of heart. He raised
a small telescope to his eye, and exclaimed to the two
colored men who were loosening the boat—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a Yankee schooner; be quick Basil!
Luke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, Massa Frank,” replied Luke, “all
ready—that’s an eastern craft, sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light barge was soon on the waves, and the
youth took the helm, while the strong arm of his
companions were engaged with the oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitors approached the vessel’s side almost
unperceived; and when the young officer ascended to
its deck, he found the captain anxiously absorbed in
examining an old map, which was spread out before
him. The expression of his weather-beaten face, as
he raised it to return the salutation of his visitor,
showed evident signs of being puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you from?” inquired the landsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Plymouth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What cargo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, a good many notions, of which you will
know presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And whither bound?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why that’s what I’m looking for on this old map,
for I see nothing like it on shore; aye, here it is, St.
Mary’s, the town of St. Mary’s, sir.”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no such town in the state, sir,” replied
the youth, “this river and the county bear that name;
there is some mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Massa captain clear out for de county,” said Basil,
grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De boss lose his reckoning dis time,” rejoined
Luke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be more respectful, and return to the boat,” said
the young officer, checking their glee; then turning
to the captain, he continued, “This map is an old
one; there was formerly a town named St. Mary on
this river—it was the first settlement in the state,
and built in the time of the Calverts, but it has passed
away and been forgotten for a century.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disappointed face of the mariner was not the
only one agitated by the news. The sailors belonging
to the vessel had joined the group, and their rough
appearance was strongly contrasted with the tall and
elegant figure of a passenger, who had been drawn by
the conversation from the cabin, and now stood leaning
against the companion way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Marylander, who had not before perceived
the stranger, thought, as he returned his
salutation, that he had seldom looked on a countenance
so interesting. It was youthful, but there was
a shade of melancholy on the fine features, which,
however, served only to confine, not hide the flashes
of an enthusiastic spirit, which glanced from his full
dark eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are out of soundings, Mr. Egerton,” said the
captain, “I might as well have cleared out for a port
in the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fault was mine, sir,” replied the person called
Egerton, “and I regret having thus led you astray;”
then, turning to the young American, he continued,
“The disappointment is also great to me, sir, for the
haven we sought was the home of my forefathers. I
am a stranger in this country, having lately arrived
from England. On landing at Plymouth I found this
schooner loading for a southern port—and, wishing
to visit Maryland immediately, I induced this worthy
but too obliging man to bring the cargo hither. The
silence of history has left the annals of Maryland so
much in the shadow, that a foreigner feels doubtful
whether a literal construction should be put on the
desertion of a town, particularly when your port of
entry also bears the name of St. Mary’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” interrupted the captain, smiling, “don’t
feel uneasy about me, for the cargo is of that accommodating
nature which will suit another town as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The customary business was soon despatched, and
the officer was leaving the vessel, but his eye lingered
on the interesting stranger. There was something in
his appearance that won his heart, and, after a moment’s
hesitation he thus spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This seems to have been your place of destination,
Mr. Egerton. Will you excuse the blunt freedom
of an American, if I ask you to accompany me
to the shore? My uncle’s dwelling is in sight. I act
as his deputy in official business, but with much more
pleasure I use another privilege, and tender you the
hospitalities of his roof. Although the town, the
principal object of your visit, is no more, yet if you
can content yourself a few days with us, you can explore
the ruins. Oakford is the name of my uncle. I
bear the same, with the simple addition of Frank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger caught his offered hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel grateful for your kindness,—the ruins!
did you say? It would indeed be a gratification to
view them—I will, with pleasure, avail myself of
your polite invitation; the ruins! are they extensive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” replied young Oakford, smiling, “there
are but few relics left by time and weather—some
remains of walls and foundations—but the most interesting
are the ruins of an ancient church—among
whose dilapidated pews a respectable audience of
weeds have accumulated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weeds, growing in the holy temple of my fathers!
what a sublime yet sad subject for reflection! I must
see them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young American again smiled at his companion’s
enthusiasm; and, as the shadows of evening
were fast closing around them, he hurried his new
friend in his preparations to leave the vessel. The
good-natured captain declined an invitation to accompany
them, as he had made arrangements to continue
his voyage farther—and, cordially shaking the hand
of his departing passenger, refused to receive any
extra compensation for the trouble occasioned. The
rough, but kind-hearted sailors also refused, but the
generous feelings of the young man were not to be
checked thus, and he forced into their unwilling hands
the expression of his thanks, as he took a kind leave
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness had veiled the landscape when the boat
reached the shore, and the warm-hearted Marylander,
drawing the arm of the young stranger within his, hurried
him up the long avenue leading to the mansion,
assuring him that his uncle would be as much gratified
as himself by this acquisition to their society.
“So, feel perfectly at ease, for we southerners use
very little ceremony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The event proved it so, for Col. Oakford, a fine
looking man, just past the meridian of life, received
him with that easy politeness and frank cordiality of
manner which relieved him from all embarrassment.
He soon discovered that his guest possessed high
literary attainments—and, enjoying those advantages
himself, the conversation became interesting,
and they parted at the hour of rest, mutually pleased
with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning arose in clouds and rain. “No
<span class='it'>ruins</span> to-day,” said the young Briton, as they met in
the breakfast room. But, although the weather prevented
any outward excursion, a well filled library
offered a pleasing substitute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young hearts soon assimilate, and friendships in
early life are quickly formed—hence, when the sun
at last broke through the clouds, on the evening of
the third day, the two youths felt on terms of intimacy
and attachment. On the fourth morning, the
lively Frank aroused his friend before sunrise, to
view, what he imagined must be to him, a novel and
imposing sight. They descended to the open piazza,
and young Egerton looked around in vain to discover
the woods, the hill, the river; all was enveloped in a
thick fog, and had the appearance of a surrounding
lake. At this moment the sun rose, and the vapor
broke on the bosom of the stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” said Frank, “the river is throwing off his
night robes—observe how gracefully he rolls and
folds them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huge white sheets of vapor were indeed majestically
receding down the current; others floated like
snow wreaths on the hills of the opposite shore—the
green sides of which, were at intervals visible through
the breaking mist, and seemed struggling beneath its
might. In gradual succession the forests and dwellings
of men appeared, and in a few minutes this
atmospheric envelope was lost in the increasing
warmth of the sun’s beams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How singular and beautiful,” said the stranger.
“Is it often thus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very frequently; at some seasons each morning
renews the scene; but you are not very robust, and
must be content to view it seldom, for this recreation
is far from healthy. The poets of your native isle
may sing of ‘walks at early dawn, through dewy
meads,’ but such strolls would make a short life
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On entering the parlor they met the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What think you of the night bath which these
lowlands take?” said he, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the morning effect is beautiful,” replied
Egerton, “but the whole must be injurious to health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, it is ever so to strangers, but we,
who are sons of the mist, fear no harm from our native
atmosphere. Yet do not think this characteristic of
our general climate. On the contrary, the northern
states, with their rock-bound sea coasts, have a clear
bracing atmosphere; the middle states, also, with
their varied surface of mountain and valley, and most
parts of the southern, are equally healthy. Our own
upper counties, and the neighboring inlands, or forest
places, as we term them, are not sickly. It is only
where the land is low, and as bountifully supplied
with bays, inlets and streams as here, that this effect
takes place; but see, ‘aunt Nora’ waits with the
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aged colored housekeeper, called by this familiar
appellation, had been the faithful nurse of the
Colonel’s infancy, and, in return, was treated by him
with great kindness. She was busied at a little table,
in a corner of the room, from which she despatched,
by the younger hands of her grandson, Luke, to a
larger table in the centre of the apartment, the fine
coffee, and more solid comforts of a Maryland breakfast,
of which the young friends hastily partook, and
then made arrangements for their visit to the <span class='it'>ruins</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was soon in readiness, and they set out,
accompanied by Basil and Luke. As the light bark
glided along the shore, Frank pointed out several
places endeared by the recollections of his childhood.
Through an opening in the trees peeped the unobtrusive
walls dedicated to country learning, with its
play ground, so often the scene of his boyish gambols,
and its clear spring under the shade of a sycamore
near the river, where a solitary cow was now
stooping to drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, Frank,” cried his friend, “she is profaning
your Helicon fount!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, let her drink, Egerton,” he replied, “for, as
she is not likely to draw more romantic inspiration
than <span class='it'>I</span> did from its waters, the spring will lose none
of its power from her draught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have gained what is worth more, sentiments
pure and disinterested, with a mind happy and
free. ’Tis true, you seldom make reminiscences—but,
if you were like me, an orphan, and a native of a
clime where, at every step, you meet some relic of
the past, you would feel differently. Your country
has but a short path to retrace, and is too young to
boast of olden days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” replied Frank, archly smiling, “there
were times to which we might refer, as equal to any
that shed glory on ancient chivalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Granted, and the treasure they left you may well
render you careless of other relics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many thanks for your liberality, my dear friend,”
said Frank, “and now for the <span class='it'>ruins</span>.” As he spoke,
the direction of the boat was changed, and they swiftly
crossed the river. Egerton sprang first on land, and
was soon deeply engaged in examination, but found
Frank’s words too true. Time and weather had
indeed been ruthless ravagers; besides, it appeared
that many materials had been removed, perhaps to
repair the cottages of the neighboring poor. But
some remains of what seemed to have been the walls
of a large store house, part of an embankment where
once had stood a fort, pits filled with rubbish, which
had been cellars, and crumbled walls, with here and
there a fallen chimney, gave melancholy testimony to
the change. Nor had the church met a better fate.
The broken in roof still clung to the shattered wall on
one side only, and hung like a dark banner, half suspended
over the desolation below; the decayed floor
had descended into the mournful cemetery beneath,
leaving some of the baseless seats clinging to the side
wall. Weeds, too, were there, whose flowers seemed
to bloom in mockery. In the sad home of the buried
dead all was confusion, broken tombs, and heaps of
rubbish. The young Briton sat down on a fragment
of the ruined wall, and Frank shared in the melancholy
of his friend, as they viewed the desolate scene.
Egerton at length broke silence. “You have, no
doubt, wondered at the deep interest I feel with regard
to these ruins. Many circumstances have led
to it, particularly a little tale related to me by a
maiden aunt, to which I listened with great delight
in childhood; and when, in after years, I was deprived
of my beloved parents, I would sometimes
beguile my sorrows by a recurrence to its sad remembrance.
Thus it became more interesting to
me, and I soon felt a desire to visit the location of
scenes so connected with my family, and with the
fate of an Indian chief of the Youcómaco tribe, called
Wiccónsat, the principal subject of the legend. If it
will give you any pleasure, I will relate it while we
rest on these sad ruins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, my dear friend,” replied Frank, “I feel
almost as sentimental as yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will take advantage of your serious mood
and commence my simple tale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among the early settlers at St. Mary’s, were the
parents of Rosalie Egerton. She was an only daughter
and beautiful. An accomplished mother had
taught her many things of which few other females
of the colony could boast. She accompanied her
harp with the songs of distant lands, and with her
needle embroidered scenes from the old world. Yet
she loved to wander amidst the wild grandeur of her
native forests, accompanied only by her little brother,
for the neighboring Indians were harmless and
friendly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wiccónsat was the son of an aged chief of the
Youcómacoes. He was tall and elegantly formed,
and straight as an arrow from his quiver. Mild and
contemplative, he became a favorite among the settlers,
from whom he learned not only to read and
write, but many of their useful arts. But he had listened
to the breathings of Rosalie’s harp, as he lingered
near her dwelling, and had gazed after her fair
form, as she wandered in the forest, until the Indian’s
life had lost all charms for him. The smile of happy
youth had fled, and when he sought his father’s wigwam,
his eye was sad and restless. The old chief
saw with sorrow the change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A spell hath come o’er thee, Wiccónsat,’ he
kindly said; ‘my son is no longer the same. When
in childhood I first saw thy little hands bend the
bow, I fondly thought thou would’st rival the hunting
fame of thy father, and, when age had weakened my
strength, should danger threaten our tribe, thou
would’st head the chiefs in combat. The locks of
Orrouiska are now gray, and his hand feeble. The
supplies of his wigwam are scanty, for his son lingers
among the better habitations of strangers. But
I know thy secret. Thy hopeless love is placed on
the fairest of the white fawns, one as far above thy
reach as was the rainbow of yesterday. For though
the son of a once powerful chief, the poorest of the
pale faces would reject thy alliance. Then arouse
thee, Wiccónsat, and despise their pride. The Great
Spirit made us all equal, and the brightest of our Indian
maidens would be proud of thy love. If thou
dost prefer the plough of the white man to the bow of
the hunter, ’tis well, but turn the furrow in thy own
fields.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The youth answered not, but with a deep sigh,
taking his quiver full of arrows, went out to the
chase. He wandered on through the forest, forgetful
of his first intention, until he found himself near the
river’s bank, and by the dwelling of Rosalie, and
soon beheld the maiden, with her little brother, in a
small boat, which they had contrived to move out a
few yards into the deep water. As she arose to
reach some blossoms from the overhanging trees, her
balance was lost, and she fell into the stream. In a
moment the young Indian had plunged in to her relief,
and bore her in safety to the bank. The cries
of her brother had alarmed the family, who hurried
to the river, and Wiccónsat, yielding his lovely burthen
to her parents’ arms, hastened to escape from
their grateful acknowledgments, to enjoy in solitude
the delightful feelings that crowded his heart. It
seemed a new era in his existence, and fairy dreams
floated in his imagination. With buoyant and unwearied
footsteps he pursued the chase, and returned
to his father’s cabin loaded with the choicest game,
the reward of his toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come, dear Oskwena,’ said he to his young sister,
who ran to welcome him, ‘prepare a feast for
our father, while I dress these skins, to make a softer
couch for his aged limbs.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Gladly, brother,’ she replied, ‘but hast thou
brought me any beads or ornaments from the colony?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, thou art too good and comely to need these
trifles. Thy lover will prize thee more without
them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thou art mistaken, brother, for Potawissa loves
to see my dark hair braided with beads, and their
bright strings encircling my neck. Thy talk will do
for the white fawns, with their cheeks like the wild
rose and foreheads like the mountain snow; but the
darker hue of Indian maids wants other ornaments.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thou hast well described the white fawns, sister,’
answered the young chief, ‘and shalt indeed
have a gay necklace; but thou hast never heard the
song of her who is brightest among them. Why the
blest sounds on the air, which are said to call our
fathers to the spirit-land on high, are not sweeter.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hush, hush,’ cried Oskwena, ‘how canst thou
talk thus? I would not hear her strain, for it hath
sadly altered thee.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bright visions of Wiccónsat were soon dispelled,
for, with the next vessel from England, arrived
a young relative of Rosalie’s family, who
brought news of their having succeeded to an estate
in their native country, to take possession of which
they now made preparations to leave America. The
charms of the maiden made an immediate impression
on the heart of the young and accomplished Briton.
His amiable qualities soon won her love, and, with
the approval of her parents, it was arranged that
their marriage should take place on their arrival in
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sad intelligence soon reached Wiccónsat, to
whom the grateful family had shown many marks of
attachment, little suspecting the sorrows they were
preparing for the youthful chief. They knew not
the secret homage of his heart, for its trembling
hopes had never been breathed to the beautiful object
of his love. In the innocence of grateful friendship,
she presented him with an embroidered belt
worked by her own hands, and assured him that she
would never forget her generous preserver.—But
when the day of their departure had arrived, and
sorrowful friends crowded the vessel’s deck to take
their last farewell, Wiccónsat was not there. Rosalie
and her parents shed tears of regret, as the sails were
spreading to waft them from their happy American
home, and as their eyes sought its peaceful roof, they
discovered near it, on a point of the river’s shore, the
solitary figure of the young chief. It was at this
spot he had rescued the maiden from a watery grave.
She eagerly waved her white handkerchief in token
of farewell, and the next moment saw the belt she
had given him, floating on the air in a returning
adieu. In a few minutes the vessel parted from the
shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many years after this, an interesting youth, accompanied
by his tutor, arrived at St. Mary’s, from
England. I know not in what state they found the
town, but the youth’s first inquiries were for an Indian
chief, called Wiccónsat, who had in early years
saved the life of his mother. He was shown a lonely
wigwam, on a point near the river. James Egerton,
for it was my great grandfather, took an early
opportunity of visiting it, but first inquired into the
present character of its inmate. ‘He is mild and
peaceful,’ said his informant, ‘and is sometimes called
the Indian Hermit, for he seldom appears abroad
except when hunting or fishing. He has lived thus
for many years, is always melancholy, and dislikes
the visits of the curious: ’Tis thought some misfortune
in his youth has led him to prefer solitude.’—Thus
informed, the young James proceeded to the
river’s side. From description, he knew where had
stood the home of his mother’s children, but sighed
to perceive it in ruins, and leaning on a fragment of
the broken wall, plucked a leaf from the vine that
still clung to it, then, with lingering footsteps, sought
the point. Seated on a rustic bench at the door of the
cabin was a figure which he knew must be the chief,
for he raised his tall, majestic form, and advanced to
meet him, but paused suddenly, and gazed earnestly
and inquiringly on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The youth felt abashed, but with some effort
addressed him: ‘Excuse this intrusion, good chief;
I am the son of her, whose life you once saved.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The recluse caught his offered hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And art thou indeed her child? oh! yes, that
eye, that smile had awoke my memory before you
spoke. Welcome art thou to the desolate Wiccónsat.’
After some conversation, the youth drew from
his bosom two small books, richly bound, and presented
them as tokens of remembrance from his mother.
The chief pressed them to his lips. ‘These will
beguile many lonely hours, but, oh! hadst thou but
brought me one lock of her hair. It was the colour
of thine,’ he added, as he passed his hand over the
rich brown curls of the son of Rosalie. ‘Alas! good
chief,’ he replied, ‘sorrow, rather than time, has
robbed those locks of their beauty. Death has bereaved
my beloved mother of her parents and of several
children. I alone survive.’ ‘And can sorrow
reach one so good? Then why should I repine?—From
this point, dear boy, I saw thy mother and her
parents depart, and here I raised my lonely habitation.
For years, I indulged the vain hope of their
return, and whenever I saw a large vessel enter the
river, I silently mingled with the crowd on the shore.
But wearied hope has long since fled, memory alone
remains.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And yet you may again behold my parents, for
it is their intention to visit Maryland in a short time.’
Surprise and joy beamed in the countenance of the
Indian, and from that hour he continued cheerful, but
his greatest present enjoyment arose from the frequent
visits of his young friend, to whom he daily
became more attached. ’Tis true, the tutor of James
disapproved of his spending so much time with one
whom he considered an untutored savage, but the
warm-hearted boy knew his Indian favorite to be
possessed of pure and lofty principles, with noble and
generous feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wiccónsat now mingled once more with the white
inhabitants, and pointed out to the inquiring youth
whatever was interesting. The remains of the Indian
village were still visible, and the few chiefs that
visited the town still fondly called it Youcómico.
But their tribe had removed to a greater distance,
and there was now little communication between
them and the colonists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several months elapsed and the time drew near
when the young Briton expected once more to embrace
his parents. They had informed him, by letter,
of their intention to embark on board the Huntress,
which would sail in two weeks, and nearly a
month had passed since the reception of this letter.
It was probable then, that they were near the American
coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the narrator paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you not proceed?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I think it will be better to finish the story
as we return. It grows late, and I wish to gather
some little remembrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From various parts of the ruins he now selected
something to carry with him, and was loading Basil
and Luke with similar trophies, who appeared to
place little value on them, as they dropped some at
every step. At length they returned to the boat, in
which they deposited the cumbrous relics, and left
the shore. But a new object excited the curiosity of
Egerton, and, with a look of entreaty, he turned to
his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been very patient and kind, dear Frank,
and now we are in the boat, let us go a little further
up the river! That point above must be the spot on
which stood the wigwam of Wiccónsat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find it a difficult matter to prove that,”
returned Frank, “however, we will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good place for fishing,” said Basil, “and
we have a line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first object that struck their view on landing
at the point, was a collection of half decayed boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here! conviction strong!” cried the delighted
Egerton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” said Frank, “they are the remains
of some old fishing hut or flat boat. Indian wigwams
are not made of boards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How incredulous you are,” returned his friend.
“Surely the melancholy chief had been long enough
among white men to adopt their materials.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, shall we load the boat with them as
relics?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are jesting; but I should really like to rebuild
it, if we had time. Where are Basil and Luke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More profitably employed—fishing; but we will
return in a day or two, and try whether a wigwam
can be made of it.” The young Briton had seated
himself on one of the boards, and seemed lost in contemplation,
while Frank quietly withdrew to see the
luck of the fishers—who, in the meantime, had not
forgotten the two youths, but, in their simple phrase,
were discussing the point at issue:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Old Nora could tell him plenty about the
Ingens,” said Basil, “for her grandmother told her,
and she saw a power of ’em in her time—but he only
seems to care about one—and I can’t say I ever
heard Nora go over such a strange name as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were smart, them chiefs, in their time,”
observed Luke, “for they say our folks learned to
make the canoes from ’em, and I’d put ’em against
any boat that swims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they won’t hold much of a crew, Luke, let
alone passengers, and as there’s four of us, and a
heavy load of Massa Egerton’s nelics, as he calls
them; besides, it’s lucky we’ve got something bigger
to float home in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their angling had not been very successful in the
short time they had engaged in it, and at Frank’s
request, the boat was again put in readiness for their
departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more on the water, Frank reminded his friend
of the promised conclusion of his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you had forgotten it,” replied Egerton,
smiling, “but I will with pleasure gratify you. I
believe we left my ancestor expecting the early arrival
of his parents at St. Mary’s, and I will now proceed
to give you the other portion of the legend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One evening, after his usual visit to the wigwam,
James was slowly returning to his lodgings. Lost in
thought, he did not at first perceive that heavy clouds
were gathering in the sky, but the sudden darkness
made him quicken his pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are late this evening, Master James,’ said
his tutor, as he met him at the door, ‘you waste a
great deal of time with that wild Indian, and I am
glad your parents are coming to take charge of you.’
‘I am glad too,’ thought his pupil, but he did not say
so, and soon after retired to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sleep of innocent youth is ever sound, and a
severe storm which arose had been raging some time
before it broke his deep slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He started from his pillow, and his first thoughts
were fears for his parents’ safety. The wind roared
fearfully, and the rain beat in torrents against his
chamber window. He looked out on the thick darkness
that obscured every object, and his heart sunk
within him at the dreary view. Overcome with the
distress of his feelings, he leaned against the casement,
and gave vent to the friendly tears that often
relieve the sadness of boyhood. Suddenly a faint
and distant flash of light broke through the gloom.
It was gone, but a sound followed which, even amid
the howling of the storm, could not be mistaken. It
struck on the ear of the weeping boy, with startling
certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It is, oh! yes, it is a signal gun of distress, oh!
my mother! my father!’ and sinking on his knees,
he breathed an agonized prayer for their safety, then
starting to his feet, he hastily threw on his clothes,
and hurried down stairs without knowing his object.
The house stood near the river, and on opening the
door he saw some person moving along the bank. He
approached; it was the chief. ‘Is it you, Wiccónsat?
oh! what a night!’ The Indian pressed his hand in
gloomy silence, and stood in a listening attitude, with
his face turned towards that part of the horizon from
whence the flash had appeared. Another gleamed
across the dismal night, and the sullen peal that followed,
fell, like the bolt of death, on their hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It is a call for aid,’ exclaimed the chief, ‘and
perhaps thy mother’s life is in danger.’ ‘And my
father’s too,’ added the shuddering boy. ‘Alas!
Wiccónsat, what can we do?’ ‘I follow that light,’
he answered, as the flash of another minute gun
shone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh! take me then with you, good chief, leave
me not here in suspense!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Alas! my boy, this stormy night ill suits thy
tender frame. Wait thou till morning breaks, then
thou canst follow with some of the townsmen. The
light seems near the mouth of the Potomac.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who speaks below,’ said the tutor’s voice from
the window; ‘surely, Master James, you are not out
on such a night?’ ‘Indeed I am,’ replied the youth,
‘there is a vessel in distress, it may be the Huntress,
in which my parents are expected; surely I cannot
sleep now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, well, if that’s the case, it’s bad enough,
but I think it’s not probable; however, I’ll be down
directly.’ By this time several of the neighbours had
joined them, and they determined to proceed in the
supposed direction of the vessel. By the first dawn
of light they found themselves on the shore of the
Potomac river, near its entrance into the Chesapeake
Bay. The rain had ceased, and daylight, as it broke
from the clouded east, shewed to their anxious gaze,
a dismasted vessel, which appeared in a wrecked and
sinking state. Two boats, crowded with the crew
and passengers, were seen contending with the raging
waves, endeavouring to reach the land. Some water
casks which had been washed on shore, were eagerly
examined by the distressed James, to discover the
name of the vessel. It met his eye, and with a cry of
terror he threw himself into the arms of the Indian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It is the Huntress! oh! Wiccónsat! my parents
will be lost!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hast thou no confidence in the Great Being thy
mother worships?’ he softly said, as he pressed him
to his breast, but his eye was fairly fixed on one of the
boats, in which he thought he could distinguish the
garments of a female. The foaming waters seemed
to threaten instant destruction to the frail barques, as
they tost from wave to wave, sometimes half hid in
the surf that broke over them. At this moment a
mingled cry reached the shore, and but one boat was
seen, the other was ’whelmed beneath the waters.
Wiccónsat broke from the clinging arms of the youth,
and plunged into the waves. For some time he was
lost to their view, but his strong and sinewy arms
forced a passage to the scene of distress, and in a short
time he was seen returning, supporting, with one arm,
the form of a female. The young James, who had
been forcibly withheld from following, now rushed to
meet him, and Rosalie (for it was she) opened her
eyes to be clasped to the bosom of her son. She lived,
she breathed, and the first word that trembled on her
lips was the name of her husband. Scarcely had she
spoken, ere the generous chief had again thrown
himself into the waves. But his strength was exhausted
by previous exertion, and when, with difficulty,
he had nearly reached the overturned boat to
which the husband of Rosalie, with others, now clung,
a floating piece of the ship’s mast struck him on the
temple. In the mean time, the other boat had safely
landed its crew, and was despatched to the aid of the
sufferers, who were all, with the exception of two,
saved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosalie had been conveyed to the nearest house,
and restoratives were applied, which soon brought
her to a state of recollection. She recognized with
joy, the form of her husband, as he knelt by the side
of her couch, and pressed, with a mother’s fondness,
the hand of her affectionate son. But her eyes wandered
around the room as if in search of another object.
‘It was a dream then,’ she murmured, ‘it was
not his, but thy dear arm that drew thy mother from
the waves.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Alas! no, it was he, the generous and the good,’
replied her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Wiccónsat! brave chief! but why those looks of
anguish; is this, my son, a time for sorrow, when
Heaven has been so kind? And my preserver, where
lingers he?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Where his bright virtues will be best rewarded,’
replied her husband, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What mean you? Surely he is safe.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He perished in an attempt to save my life.’ She
heard no more, for she had fainted in the arms of her
son, and it was long ere she revived, to mingle with
theirs her tears of unavailing regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the afternoon the body of the generous Indian
was washed on shore. With every mark of respect
it was conveyed to the town, and preparations made
for its interment on the following day at the point, in
a spot once pointed out, by the chief, to young Egerton.
The grief of this affectionate boy burst without
restraint, as he leaned over the body of his departed
friend, and his tears flowed afresh, when he was
shown a folded paper, which had been found in his
bosom. It was wet through, and contained the faded
belt, the treasured gift of Rosalie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Intelligence of the sad event was conveyed to the
sister of the chief, and the next day, accompanied by
her husband and sons, and several warriors of the
Youcómaco tribe, Oskwena arrived, just as the funeral
procession was moving to the grave. Time had
altered this once beautiful daughter of the forest;
there was a mildness in her look of grief, as she left
the canoe, and led by her two sons, approached the
open grave, where, seating herself by its side, she silently
awaited the mournful train that bore her brother
to his last home. She uttered a faint cry as her
eye rested on the coffin, and her whole frame shook
with agitation, when it was lowered from her sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chiefs arranged themselves in gloomy silence
around the grave of him, who, in early youth, had
been the boast of their tribe, and heard, rather than
listened, to the funeral service. It was scarcely ended,
when the hitherto restrained grief of Oskwena
burst forth. She tore from her dishevelled locks the
rude ornaments of her tribe, scattering them on the
ground, but a necklace of beads she retained in her
hand, and wept bitterly as she looked on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It was thy gift, Wiccónsat,’ said the mourner,
‘thy face glowed with youth and hope on the happy
day thou gavest it. Our aged father blessed his children,
for he had not then passed to the spirit-land
above. The beads are bright yet, but thou art faded
and gone. I can gaze on them no more, they shall
be hid with thee,’ and she dropped them into the
grave. The spectators looked on her with pity and
disturbed her not, as in a low voice she chaunted a
wild funeral melody. When she ceased, several young
maidens of St. Mary’s, arrayed in white, approached,
and scattered flowers around the grave. The oldest
son of Oskwena stood, with his father, among the
chiefs. To him the beauty of the white maidens was
new, for he had never before been allowed to visit the
town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who are they?’ he asked, eagerly leaning forward,
but then the stern Potawissa drew him back, as
he replied in a low voice, ‘It matters not, it is enough
that they cannot be aught to thee. Look not on
their fatal beauty, but let that lonely grave warn thee
of danger. It was hopeless love for a pale face like
theirs, that induced thy mother’s brother to forsake
the tribe that idolized him; to lead a life of solitude,
and at last to perish for her sake. And now he sleeps
not with the bones of his fathers, and the talk of the
white man is heard by his grave, instead of the bold
death song of our chiefs. Nay, thou art gazing still;
turn from them boy,’ and suddenly drawing him
round, he held him firmly until the fair group had retired.
A faint shriek from Oskwena drew his attention.
He saw the attendants were filling up the grave,
and hastened to remove her sinking form. In a few
minutes the crowd had dispersed, the chiefs again
entered their boats, and young Egerton, with his father,
alone remained on the silent shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The family remained but a short time in Maryland,
for the health of Rosalie had sustained a shock
from which it never recovered. She faded before the
agonized view of her husband and son, and died shortly
after their return to England. As one of their
descendants, I have long wished to visit the scene of
their sorrows, and in doing so, I have formed a friendship
which, believe me, dear Frank, will always be
cherished in my heart. The kind hospitality of your
good uncle made me forget I was a stranger, and
though we must part in a few days, time or distance
will never erase the remembrance of my American
friends.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> moon shone serenely clear over hill and dale,
her silver rays playing on the dull gray earth with
sportive fancy, while not a zephyr seemed upon the
wing, and all nature slumbered in the stillness of a
warm summer evening, when, from one of the neat
white cottages of the village of ——, issued two
figures, completely enveloped in cloaks, notwithstanding
the thermometer stood at nearly ninety.
Not a word was spoken, but with stealthy steps they
chased their shadows along the silent streets for a
good half mile; although twice or thrice one of the
figures paused and heaved convulsively, whether
from lack of breath or agitation seemed doubtful.
At length they stopped before a cottage, whose proximity
to the church bespoke the <span class='it'>parsonage</span>; a light
twinkled through the casement; the muffled fugitives
rapt gently at the door; it was opened, and
they entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old moss-grown church clock had just proclaimed,
in solemn tones, the hour of nine, on the
next morning, when two ladies, whose looks bespoke
them far upon the road of <span class='it'>time</span>—clad in black silk
bonnets and mitts—came slowly down the streets,
shaded by the spreading elms. These good gossips
appeared deeply engaged in conversation, looking so
intently into each other’s face, that sundry fowls,
young pigs, and small dogs miraculously escaped a
sudden and violent death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you believe it yet, Mrs. Potts?” cried the
lesser of the two ladies; “such a reflection upon our
quiet village—good gracious and powers! preserve
us from such assurance.” Thus saying, she rolled
up the balls of her eyes, and clasped her hands together
with pious fervor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not only that, my dear Miss Clapper, but such
an example to the daughters of the place!” and Mrs.
Potts sighed, as she thought of her six damsels, who
still remained in single blessedness, notwithstanding
the many little innocent manœuvres to which mammas
will sometimes have recourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, it behoves you, Mrs. Potts, to keep
a sharp look-out. Will you visit her—the good-for-naught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“W-e-ll, what do you think about it? If <span class='it'>we</span> cut
her all the village will. What say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure, to be sure, that’s true; her place in
society depends upon <span class='it'>us</span>, my dear. She gives such
pleasant parties, such excellent soft waffles, and then
one meets sometimes such agreeable people from the
city there, which gives the girls a chance, you know,
(winking knowingly,) that it would be a pity to
throw her off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you, my dear Miss Clapper—and—after
all, she’s honestly married, although she stole
away, like a thief in the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we just stop and ask Katy a few questions.
May be they wish to keep it a secret. Here
we are by the house—shall we stop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no objections, my dear; but you’ll get nothing
out of that piece of sour-crout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll pump her; leave me alone for <span class='it'>that</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly the two loving, neighborly gossips
rapt at the door of the white cottage from whence
had stolen forth the fugitives the night previous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loud knock announced the aristocracy of the
village; the door opened, and the sharp bluish features
of Katy filled up the aperture. Her small
<span class='it'>gravy</span> eyes blinked for a moment when she beheld
the visitors; the next Katy stood the personification
of gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Katy,” cried Miss Clapper, in her most
dulcet tones, “how <span class='it'>do</span> you do this fine morn? all
well, I hope,” making an effort to open wider the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, Miss; a very fine morning, and we
are all well, thanks be to goodness,” answered Katy,
holding the door still closer, and protruding her nose
still farther, so that the sudden slam of the door
would have deprived that venerable spinster of that
most conspicuous of all features, a <span class='it'>red nose</span>. “Sorry
I can’t ask you both in—but nobody’s home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! so, then, it’s true, what we heard this morning,”
said Mrs. Potts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say, indeed, Marm, as I don’t know what
you might have heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! only that your mistress ran off last night
and was married, and went away this morning in the
village hack,” almost screamed Miss Clapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so my mistress <span class='it'>is</span> married, and I know
some that would like to be in her shoes, if they could
but get the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, Katy, no offence is meant,” cried
Mrs. Potts; “when will the bride be home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She bade me tell you, Marm, and Miss Clapper,
(and she wants you to tell the village) that on Thursday
evening the doors will be thrown open and the
candles lighted, and you will see <span class='it'>her</span> and <span class='it'>plenty</span> of
wedding cake and good wine.” Thus saying, she
gently closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So! it’s no secret after all,” cried Mrs. Potts;
“Katy made no bones at confession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! the old she devil! how I hate that creature—she
always <span class='it'>Miss-es</span> one so—never calls me
any thing but <span class='it'>Miss</span>!—<span class='it'>Miss!</span>—She shan’t read it
on my tomb-stone, if I can help it,” muttered <span class='it'>Miss</span>
Clapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faithfully did these village circulars perform their
agreeable task. Before the sun sank to rest, every
individual, from the lady of the member of the legislature
to the shoe-black in the inn, had heard the
news, and had formed dreams of the coming event.
The bride and bride-cake—beaux and belles, had
been reviewed in the mind’s eye o’er and o’er again.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When a young man, Mr. Hopkins arrived upon the
spot where now stands the village of ——, with his
bundle upon his stick, his sole fortune. He became
what may be termed a squatter. It was then a dreary
waste of girdled trees, and patches covered with
black stumps. But his untiring perseverance and
systematic industry were rewarded in time by beholding,
from his cottage door, the fields of waving corn
and the golden wheat, where once lurked the savage
and prowled the ravenous beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In course of time, the place became settled; the
present village sprang into existence; Mr. Hopkins
“grew with its growth, and strengthened with its
strength;” in short, Mr. Hopkins became a rich man,
and consequently a man of consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hopkins (poor good soul) died ere she could
enjoy the wealth that her patient labors had assisted
her husband in accumulating. She left one daughter,
christened Dinah, and two sons. Upon the death of
the “old man,” the sons moved to a strange land,
(that is, about a hundred miles from their native
vale.) Miss Dinah, or rather Diana, as she chose to
be called, after the immortal Die Vernon, remained
upon the “old place,” to uphold, as she properly said,
the dignity of the Hopkinses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus years wore away. Miss Die became the
tyrant of fashion in her own village. She read
Shakspeare, doated on Byron, and was subdued by
Sir Walter Scott’s works. She languished and quoted
poetry for nearly forty years. In youth, she
scorned the rustic beaux that kneeled at her shrine;
and, as years sped onward, none “bowed nor told
their tale of love,” until, at length, Miss Die began
seriously to think of a visit to her brothers, when the
kind <span class='it'>fates</span> brought Mr. Micalf to the village, and
there left him to the mercy of Cupid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>major</span> (as he was familiarly called) was rather
short of stature, with an alderman’s corpulency,—famous
for his good-nature, intolerable indolence, and
devotion to whiskey-punch and the noxious weed.
Being asthmatic, he seldom had recourse to any exertion—a
long walk would cause him to puff and
blow at least for a minute, ere he could catch breath
to utter a word. Still Mr. Micalf found breath enough
to become a successful wooer—and Miss Die persuaded
her swain to elope with her by moonlight, as
she could never survive the stare of the plebeians by
the light of “gaudy day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It ever remained a doubt in the village, what was
the exact age of the major. Many were of an opinion
that sixty winters had frosted his brow. Others again
asserted that he did not number, by a score, as many
years as his bride. These latter, however, were the
ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thursday arrived—and, after a weary watching
from many a beaming eye, the sun at length disappeared
behind the distant mountains, and twilight
gently threw over the glowing sky its mantle of sombre
gray. Lights flitted to and fro through the
houses; an unusual bustle hummed through the quiet
streets; the horses, disturbed after a day of labor,
to be brought forth and harnessed to whatever vehicle
their masters could boast of possessing, hung
down their weary heads, with slow and measured
steps patiently submitting to the yoke of bondage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden glare of lights, that streamed through
the casements of the white cottage over the gravel
walks, announced that preparations had ceased, and
that visitors were momentarily expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the bride, her tall gaunt figure arrayed
in white, flitting from room to room, not knowing
where to station herself to make the best impression,
and inwardly chafing at the perfume of tobacco
that met her olfactory nerves, and the loss of her
reticule, wherein were the keys of sundry closets
and so forth, when the door opened and Mr., Mrs.,
and the four Misses Potts, with Miss Clapper, beheld
the bride upon knees and hands, looking under an immense
old-fashioned settee for her lost treasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Micalf looked up, sprang to her feet, uttered
a faint scream, and for a moment hid her face—then
yielded her cheek to the salutations of the six ladies,
and with much coyness permitted Mr. Potts to touch
the tip of her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I declare, I think you served us a pretty
trick, Mrs. Micalf—a lady of your years to make a
moonlight flitting—oh, fie!” cried Miss Clapper, in
a querulous voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, spare me, dear friends; I feel the full force
of the imprudence of the step. But be this my excuse,
‘I’ve scanned the actions of his daily life,’ and
flatter myself I have secured happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mr. Micalf to steal away so—he who hates
walking so. Why, I thought it would almost have
killed him to walk so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, old lady,” cried the groom, who
had entered unperceived, and slapping Miss Clapper
upon the shoulder; “I can’t believe it yet; I haven’t
drawn a long breath since—wheugh!—But Die
would not be married any other way, though I told
her we were making a couple of old fools of ourselves—wheugh—u—u—Never
mind, Die, don’t be
cast down at being called old—we all know you were
young once! ha, ha! wheugh—u! Come, Potts,
let’s go and drink good luck to midnight walks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Micalf is so boisterous when he is in good
spirits, and he does so love to plague me!” cried the
bride, the quivering of her nostrils and upper lip expressing
the workings of the inward passions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knock succeeded knock, and the influx of visitors,
with the oft-repeated “wish you joy, wish you joy,”
soon restored harmony to the spirits of the bride,
who was in extacies at the crowd that had gathered
around her. She quoted poetry, right and left; forgot,
for the moment, that tobacco and punch existed;
and some assert that even the major was forgotten!
That was but scandal, however. Nevertheless, the
major enjoyed seven pipes and five tumblers of punch,
without once hearing the sound of Die’s voice; a
luxury which, in the warmth of his feelings he solemnly
whispered to Potts, had not been permitted
him since his moonlight trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours sped onward—the merry laugh that
rang so loud and clear from the midst of a group of
young folks who were playing “hunt the slipper,”
“my lady’s toilette,” &amp;c. caused the heads of the
matrons to turn from each other in high displeasure
at the interruption of some tale of scandal!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happiest moments, still the fleetest!—the
hour arrived—the guests departed, and the mistress
of the <span class='it'>fairy</span> scene began to wonder what had become
of her lord. Looking through the empty rooms,
peering in every corner by the aid of a feeble night-lamp,
and almost suffocated with the vapor of candle-snuff,
she was startled by the sonorous notes from
her husband’s nasal organ. “I do believe the ass
has gone to bed,” she mentally ejaculated. Rushing
into her room, she beheld the head of the major, with
his blue and white night-cap snugly resting upon her
fine linen <span class='it'>day</span> pillow-cases. Jerking the pillows from
under the offending head, she screamed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Major! why, Micalf, you are sleeping upon my
beautiful cases with real thread-lace borders!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, what is the matter? Is the house on
fire? O Lord, I smell smoke—fire!—fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do be quiet now, and don’t make a fool of yourself;
it’s only the pillow I wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Die! is that you? You have frightened the
very life out of me. Give me something to put under
my head; my neck is almost broke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, my dear, is the night pillow. Now, never
presume to go to bed again, until the cover is turned
down and the day cases removed, and—bless me,
how you have tossed the bed! Why, major, major,
are you asleep already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, for heaven’s sake? Am I never to
know what rest is again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear—major, I say, shall I tuck you up
snugly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! the devil! I don’t want to be reminded of
my coffin every night by being tucked up,” and away
went the clothes from the foot and side. “Oh, how
I wish——” groaned the major, as Mrs. Micalf again
patiently smoothed them down. The wish died upon
his tongue, but it was embodied in his dreams:—Once
more he was the quiet possessor of the snug
little room, and no less snug little bed, at the “Full
Moon,” the atmosphere dense with tobacco-smoke
and the vapor of whiskey-punch regaling his nose—when
the shrill, sharp voice of his help-meet, at dawn
of day, dispelled the illusion, and, with the sun, he
arose with the comfortable thought that he was not
the only being that had sold peace and happiness for
<span class='it'>gold</span>. And, ere the honey-moon had expired, Mr.
and Mrs. Micalf began to perceive that they had
made a great mistake in their moonlight flitting.</p>

<img src='images/i076.jpg' alt='Signature of Edgar A. Poe' id='iid-0004' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Under this head, some years ago, there appeared,
in the Southern Literary Messenger, an article which
attracted very general attention, not less from the
nature of its subject than from the peculiar manner
in which it was handled. The editor introduces his
readers to a certain Mr. Joseph Miller, who, it is
hinted, is not merely a descendant of the illustrious
Joe, of Jest-Book notoriety, but that identical individual
in proper person. Upon this point, however,
an air of uncertainty is thrown by means of an equivoque,
maintained throughout the paper, in respect
to Mr. Miller’s middle name. This equivoque is put
into the mouth of Mr. M. himself. He gives his
name, in the first instance, as Joseph A. Miller; but,
in the course of conversation, shifts it to Joseph B.,
then to Joseph C., and so on through the whole alphabet,
until he concludes by desiring a copy of the
Magazine to be sent to his address as Joseph Z.
Miller, Esquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of his visit to the editor is to place
in his hands the autographs of certain distinguished
American <span class='it'>literati</span>. To these persons he had written
rigmarole letters on various topics, and in all cases
had been successful in eliciting a reply. The replies
only (which it is scarcely necessary to say are all
fictitious) are given in the Magazine, with a genuine
autograph fac-simile appended, and are either burlesques
of the supposed writer’s usual style, or rendered
otherwise absurd by reference to the nonsensical
questions imagined to have been propounded by
Mr. Miller. The autographs thus given are twenty-six
in all—corresponding to the twenty-six variations
in the initial letter of the hoaxer’s middle name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the public this article took amazingly well,
and many of our principal papers were at the expense
of re-printing it with the wood-cut autographs. Even
those whose names had been introduced, and whose
style had been burlesqued, took the joke, generally
speaking, in good part. Some of them were at a loss
what to make of the matter. Dr. W. E. Channing,
of Boston, was at some trouble, it is said, in calling
to mind whether he had or had not actually written
to some Mr. Joseph Miller the letter attributed to
him in the article. This letter was nothing more
than what follows:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Boston</span>, ——.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>No such person as Philip Philpot has ever been in
my employ as a coachman, or otherwise. The name
is an odd one, and not likely to be forgotten. The
man must have reference to some other Doctor Channing.
It would be as well to question him closely.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.25em;'>W. E. CHANNING.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'>To <span class='sc'>Joseph X. Miller</span>, Esq.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The precise and brief sententiousness of the divine
is here, it will be seen, very truly adopted, or “hit off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one instance only was the <span class='it'>jeu-d’esprit</span> taken in
serious dudgeon. Colonel Stone and the Messenger
had not been upon the best of terms. Some one of
the Colonel’s little brochures had been severely
treated by that journal, which declared that the
work would have been far more properly published
among the quack advertisements in a spare corner
of the Commercial. The colonel had retaliated by
wholesale vituperation of the Messenger. This being
the state of affairs, it was not to be wondered at
that the following epistle was not quietly received on
the part of him to whom it was attributed:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>New York</span>, ——.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am exceedingly and excessively sorry that it is
out of my power to comply with your rational and
reasonable request. The subject you mention is one
with which I am utterly unacquainted. Moreover it
is one about which I know very little.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Respectfully,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.25em;'>W. L. STONE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Joseph V. Miller</span>, Esq.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These tautologies and anti-climaces were too much
for the colonel, and we are ashamed to say that he
committed himself by publishing in the Commercial
an indignant denial of ever having indited such an
epistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The principal feature of this autograph article,
although perhaps the least interesting, was that
of the editorial comment upon the supposed MSS.,
regarding them as indicative of character. In these
comments the design was never more than semi-serious.
At times, too, the writer was evidently led
into error or injustice through the desire of being
pungent—not unfrequently sacrificing truth for the
sake of a <span class='it'>bon-mot</span>. In this manner qualities were
often attributed to individuals, which were not so
much indicated by their hand-writing, as suggested
by the spleen of the commentator. But that a strong
analogy <span class='it'>does</span> generally and naturally exist between
every man’s chirography and character, will be denied
by none but the unreflecting. It is not our purpose,
however, to enter into the <span class='it'>philosophy</span> of this
subject, either in this portion of the present paper,
or in the abstract. What we may have to say will
be introduced elsewhere, and in connection with particular
MSS. The practical application of the theory
will thus go hand in hand with the theory itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our design is three-fold:—In the first place, seriously
to illustrate our position that the mental features
are indicated (with certain exceptions) by the
hand-writing; secondly, to indulge in a little literary
gossip; and, thirdly, to furnish our readers with a
more accurate and at the same time a more general
collection of the autographs of our <span class='it'>literati</span> than is to
be found elsewhere. Of the first portion of this design
we have already spoken. The second speaks
for itself. Of the third it is only necessary to say
that we are confident of its interest for all lovers of
literature. Next to the person of a distinguished
man-of-letters, we desire to see his portrait—next
to his portrait, his autograph. In the latter, especially,
there is something which seems to bring him
before us in his true idiosyncrasy—in his character
of <span class='it'>scribe</span>. The feeling which prompts to the collection
of autographs is a natural and rational one. But
complete, or even extensive collections, are beyond
the reach of those who themselves do not dabble in
the waters of literature. The writer of this article
has had opportunities, in this way, enjoyed by few.
The MSS. now lying before him are a motley mass
indeed. Here are letters, or other compositions, from
every individual in America who has the slightest
pretension to literary celebrity. From these we propose
to select the most eminent names—as to give
<span class='it'>all</span> would be a work of supererogation. Unquestionably,
among those whose claims we are forced to
postpone, are several whose high <span class='it'>merit</span> might justly
demand a different treatment; but the rule applicable
in a case like this seems to be that of celebrity,
rather than that of true worth. It will be understood
that, in the necessity of selection which circumstances
impose upon us, we confine ourselves <span class='it'>to the
most noted among the living literati of the country</span>.
The article above alluded to, embraced, as we have
already stated, only twenty-six names, and was not
occupied <span class='it'>exclusively</span> either with living persons, or,
properly speaking, with literary ones. In fact the
whole paper seemed to acknowledge no law beyond
that of whim. Our present essay will be found to
include <span class='it'>one hundred autographs</span>. We have thought
it unnecessary to preserve any particular order in
their arrangement.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i080.jpg' alt='Signature of Chas (Charles) Anthon' id='iid-0005' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Professor <span class='sc'>Charles Anthon</span>, of Columbia College,
New York, is well known as the most erudite of our
classical scholars; and, although still a young man,
there are few, if any, even in Europe, who surpass
him in his peculiar path of knowledge. In England
his supremacy has been tacitly acknowledged by the
immediate re-publication of his editions of Cæsar,
Sallust, and Cicero, with other works, and their adoption
as text-books at Oxford and Cambridge. His
amplification of Lemprière did him high honor, but,
of late, has been entirely superseded by a Classical
Dictionary of his own—a work most remarkable for
the extent and comprehensiveness of its details, as
well as for its historical, chronological, mythological,
and philological <span class='it'>accuracy</span>. It has at once completely
overshadowed every thing of its kind. It
follows, as a matter of course, that Mr. Anthon has
many little enemies, among the inditers of merely
big books. He has not been unassailed, yet has assuredly
remained uninjured in the estimation of all
those whose opinion he would be likely to value.
We do not mean to say that he is altogether without
faults, but a certain antique Johnsonism of style is
perhaps one of his worst. He was mainly instrumental
(with Professor Henry and Dr. Hawks) in
setting on foot the New York Review, a journal of
which he is the most efficient literary support, and
whose most erudite papers have always been furnished
by his pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chirography of Professor Anthon is the most
regularly beautiful of any in our collection. We see
the most scrupulous precision, finish, and neatness
about every portion of it—in the formation of individual
letters, as well as in the <span class='it'>tout-ensemble</span>. The
perfect symmetry of the MS. gives it, to a casual
glance, the appearance of Italic print. The lines are
quite straight, and at exactly equal distances, yet
are written without black rules, or other artificial aid.
There is not the slightest superfluity, in the way of
flourish or otherwise, with the exception of the twirl
in the C of the signature. Yet the whole is rather
neat and graceful than forcible. Of four letters now
lying before us, one is written on pink, one on a faint
blue, one on green, and one on yellow paper—all of
the finest quality. The seal is of green wax, with
an impression of the head of Cæsar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in the chirography of such men as Professor
Anthon that we look with certainty for indication of
character. The life of a scholar is mostly undisturbed
by those adventitious events which distort the
natural disposition of the man of the world, preventing
his real nature from manifesting itself in his MS.
The lawyer, who, pressed for time, is often forced to
embody a world of heterogeneous memoranda, on
scraps of paper, with the stumps of all varieties of
pen, will soon find the fair characters of his boyhood
degenerate into hieroglyphics which would puzzle
Doctor Wallis or Champollion; and from chirography
so disturbed it is nearly impossible to decide
any thing. In a similar manner, men who pass
through many striking vicissitudes of life, acquire in
each change of circumstance a temporary inflection
of the hand-writing; the whole resulting, after many
years, in an unformed or variable MS., scarcely to be
recognised by themselves from one day to the other.
In the case of literary men generally, we may expect
some decisive token of the mental influence upon the
MS., and in the instance of the classical devotee we
may look with <span class='it'>especial</span> certainty for such token. We
see, accordingly, in Professor Anthon’s autography,
each and all of the known idiosyncrasies of his taste
and intellect. We recognise at once the scrupulous
precision and finish of his scholarship and of his
style—the love of elegance which prompts him to
surround himself, in his private study, with gems of
sculptural art, and beautifully bound volumes, all
arranged with elaborate attention to form, and in the
very pedantry of neatness. We perceive, too, the
disdain of superfluous embellishment which distinguishes
his compilations, and which gives to their
exterior appearance so marked an air of Quakerism.
We must not forget to observe that the “want of
force” is a want as perceptible in the whole character
of the man, as in that of the MS.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i084.jpg' alt='Signature of Washington Irving' id='iid-0006' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The MS. of Mr. <span class='sc'>Irving</span> has little about it indicative
of his genius. Certainly, no one could suspect from
it any nice <span class='it'>finish</span> in the writer’s compositions; nor is
this nice finish to be found. The letters now before
us vary remarkably in appearance; and those of late
date are not nearly so well written as the more antique.
Mr. Irving has travelled much, has seen many
vicissitudes, and has been so thoroughly satiated with
fame as to grow slovenly in the performance of his
literary tasks. This slovenliness has affected his
hand-writing. But even from his earlier MSS. there
is little to be gleaned, except the ideas of simplicity
and precision. It must be admitted, however, that
this fact, in itself, is characteristic of the literary
manner, which, however excellent, has no prominent
or very remarkable features.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i085.jpg' alt='Signature of Park Benjamin' id='iid-0007' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>For the last six or seven years, few men have occupied
a more desirable position among us than Mr.
<span class='sc'>Benjamin</span>. As the editor of the American Monthly
Magazine, of the New Yorker, and more lately of
the Signal, and New World, he has exerted an influence
scarcely second to that of any editor in the
country. This influence Mr. B. owes to no single
cause, but to his combined ability, activity, causticity,
fearlessness, and independence. We use the
latter term, however, with some mental reservation.
The editor of the World is independent so far as the
word implies unshaken resolution to follow the bent
of one’s own will, let the consequences be what they
may. He is no respecter of persons, and his vituperation
as often assails the powerful as the powerless—indeed
the latter fall rarely under his censure.
But we cannot call his independence, at all times,
that of principle. We can never be sure that he will
defend a cause merely because it is the cause of
truth—or even because he regards it as such. He is
too frequently biassed by personal feelings—feelings
now of friendship, and again of vindictiveness. He
is a warm friend, and a bitter, but not implacable
enemy. His judgment in literary matters should not
be questioned, but there is some difficulty in getting
at his real opinion. As a prose writer, his style is
lucid, terse, and pungent. He is often witty, often
cuttingly sarcastic, but seldom humorous. He frequently
injures the force of his fiercest attacks by an
indulgence in merely vituperative epithets. As a
poet, he is entitled to far higher consideration than
that in which he is ordinarily held. He is skilful and
passionate, as well as imaginative. His sonnets have
not been surpassed. In short, it is as a poet that his
better genius is evinced—it is in poetry that his
noble spirit breaks forth, showing what the man is,
and what, but for unhappy circumstances, he would
invariably appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Benjamin’s MS. is not very dissimilar to
Mr. Irving’s, and, like his, it has no doubt been
greatly modified by the excitements of life, and by
the necessity of writing much and hastily; so that
we can predicate but little respecting it. It speaks
of his exquisite sensibility and passion. These betray
themselves in the nervous variation of the MS. as
the subject is diversified. When the theme is an ordinary
one, the writing is legible and has force; but
when it verges upon any thing which may be supposed
to excite, we see the characters falter as they
proceed. In the MSS. of some of his best poems
this peculiarity is very remarkable. The signature
conveys the idea of his <span class='it'>usual</span> chirography.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i087.jpg' alt='Signature of John P. Kennedy' id='iid-0008' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Kennedy</span> is well known as the author of
“Swallow Barn,” “Horse-Shoe Robinson,” and “Rob
of the Bowl,” three works whose features are strongly
and decidedly marked. These features are boldness
and force of thought, (disdaining ordinary embellishment,
and depending for its effect upon masses
rather than upon details) with a predominant <span class='it'>sense
of the picturesque</span> pervading and giving color to the
whole. His “Swallow Barn,” in especial (and it is
by the first effort of an author that we form the truest
idea of his mental bias), is but a rich succession of
picturesque still-life pieces. Mr. Kennedy is well to
do in the world, and has always taken the world
easily. We may therefore expect to find in his chirography,
if ever in any, a full indication of the chief
feature of his literary style—especially as this chief
feature is so remarkably prominent. A glance at his
signature will convince any one that the indication
is to be found. A painter called upon to designate
the main peculiarity of this MS. would speak at once
of the <span class='it'>picturesque</span>. This character is given it by the
absence of hair-strokes, and by the abrupt termination
of every letter without tapering; also in great
measure by varying the size and slope of the letters.
Great uniformity is preserved in the whole air of the
MS., with great variety in the constituent parts.
Every character has the clearness, boldness and precision
of a wood-cut. The long letters do not rise or
fall in an undue degree above the others. Upon the
whole, this is a hand which pleases us much, although
its <span class='it'>bizarrerie</span> is rather too piquant for the general
taste. Should its writer devote himself more exclusively
to light letters, we predict his future eminence.
The paper on which our epistles are written is very
fine, clear, and <span class='it'>white</span>, with gilt edges. The seal is
neat, and just sufficient wax has been used for the
impression. All this betokens a love of the elegant
without effeminacy.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i089.jpg' alt='Signature of G: Mellen' id='iid-0009' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The hand-writing of <span class='sc'>Grenville Mellen</span> is somewhat
peculiar, and partakes largely of the character of
his signature as seen above. The whole is highly indicative
of the poet’s flighty, hyper-fanciful character,
with his unsettled and often erroneous ideas of the
beautiful. His straining after effect is well paralleled
in the formation of the preposterous G in the
signature, with the two dots by its side. Mr. Mellen
has genius unquestionably, but there is something
in his temperament which obscures it.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<img src='images/i089b.jpg' alt='Signature of J K Paulding' id='iid-0010' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>No correct notion of Mr. <span class='sc'>Paulding’s</span> literary peculiarities
can be obtained from an inspection of his
MS., which, no doubt, has been strongly modified by
adventitious circumstances. His small <span class='it'>a</span>s, <span class='it'>t</span>s, and
<span class='it'>c</span>s are all alike, and the style of the characters generally
is French, although the entire MS. has much
the appearance of Greek text. The paper which he
ordinarily uses is of a very fine glossy texture, and
of a blue tint, with gilt edges. His signature is a
good specimen of his general hand.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i090a.jpg' alt='Signature of L. H. Sigourney' id='iid-0011' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>Sigourney</span> seems to take much pains with her
MSS. Apparently she employs <span class='it'>black lines</span>. Every
<span class='it'>t</span> is crossed, and every <span class='it'>i</span> dotted, with precision, while
the punctuation is faultless. Yet the whole has nothing
of effeminacy or formality. The individual
characters are large, well and freely formed, and
preserve a perfect uniformity throughout. Something
in her hand-writing puts us in mind of Mr. Paulding’s.
In both MSS. perfect regularity exists, and
in both the style is <span class='it'>formed</span> or <span class='it'>decided</span>. Both are
beautiful; yet Mrs. Sigourney’s is the most legible,
and Mr. Paulding’s nearly the most illegible in the
world. From that of Mrs. S. we might easily form
a true estimate of her compositions. Freedom, dignity,
precision, and grace, without originality, may
be properly attributed to her. She has fine taste,
without genius. Her paper is usually good—the seal
small, of green and gold wax, and without impression.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i090b.jpg' alt='Signature of Robert Walsh' id='iid-0012' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Walsh’s</span> MS. is peculiar, from its large, sprawling
and irregular appearance—rather rotund than
angular. It always seems to have been hurriedly
written. The <span class='it'>t</span>s are crossed with a sweeping scratch
of the pen, which gives to his epistles a somewhat
droll appearance. A <span class='it'>dictatorial</span> air pervades the
whole. His paper is of ordinary quality. His seal
is commonly of brown wax mingled with gold, and
bears a Latin motto, of which only the words <span class='it'>trans</span>
and <span class='it'>mortuus</span> are legible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Walsh cannot be denied talent; but his reputation,
which has been bolstered into being by a
<span class='it'>clique</span>, is not a thing to live. A blustering self-conceit
betrays itself in his chirography, which upon
the whole, is not very dissimilar to that of Mr. E.
Everett, of whom we shall speak hereafter.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i091.jpg' alt='Signature of J H Ingraham' id='iid-0013' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Ingraham</span>, or Ingrahame, (for he writes his
name sometimes with, and sometimes without the <span class='it'>e</span>,)
is one of our most <span class='it'>popular</span> novelists, if not one of our
best. He appeals always to the taste of the ultra-romanticists,
(as a matter, we believe, rather of pecuniary
policy than of choice) and thus is obnoxious to
the charge of a certain cut-and-thrust, blue-fire, melodramaticism.
Still, he is capable of better things. His
chirography is very unequal; at times, sufficiently
clear and flowing, at others, shockingly scratchy and
uncouth. From it nothing whatever can be predicated,
except an uneasy vacillation of temper and of purpose.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i092a.jpg' alt='Signature of W C Bryant' id='iid-0014' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Bryant’s</span> MS. puts us entirely at fault. It is
one of the most common-place clerk’s hands which
we ever encountered, and has no character about it
beyond that of the day-book and ledger. He writes,
in short, what mercantile men and professional pen-men
call a fair hand, but what artists would term an
abominable one. Among its regular up and down
strokes, waving lines and hair-lines, systematic taperings
and flourishes, we look in vain for the force,
polish, and decision of the poet. The <span class='it'>picturesque</span>,
to be sure, is equally deficient in his chirography and
in his poetical productions.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i092b.jpg' alt='Signature of Fitz-Greene Halleck' id='iid-0015' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Halleck’s</span> hand is strikingly indicative of his
genius. We see in it some force, more grace, and
little of the picturesque. There is a great deal of
freedom about it, and his MSS. seem to be written
<span class='it'>currente calamo</span>, but without hurry. His flourishes,
which are not many, look as if thoughtfully planned,
and deliberately, yet firmly executed. His paper is
very good, and of a blueish tint—his seal of red wax.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i093a.jpg' alt='Signature of N. P. Willis.' id='iid-0016' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Willis</span>, when writing carefully, would write a
hand nearly resembling that of Mr. Halleck; although
no similarity is perceptible in the signatures. His
usual chirography is dashing, free, and not ungraceful,
but is sadly deficient in force and picturesqueness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been the fate of this gentleman to be alternately
condemned <span class='it'>ad infinitum</span>, and lauded <span class='it'>ad nauseam</span>—a
fact which speaks much in his praise. We
know of no American writer who has evinced greater
versatility of talent; that is to say, of high talent,
often amounting to genius; and we know of none who
has more narrowly missed placing himself at the head
of our letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The paper of Mr. Willis’ epistles is always fine, and
glossy. At present, he employs a somewhat large
seal, with a dove, or carrier-pigeon, at the top, the
word “Glenmary” at bottom, and the initials “N.
P. W.” in the middle.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i093b.jpg' alt='Signature of Rufus Dawes' id='iid-0017' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Dawes</span> has been long known as a poet; but his
claims are scarcely yet settled—his friends giving
him rank with Bryant and Halleck, while his opponents
treat his pretensions with contempt. The truth
is, that the author of “Geraldine” and “Athenia of
Damascus” has written occasional verses very well—so
well, that some of his minor pieces may be considered
equal to any of the minor pieces of either
of the two gentlemen above-mentioned. His longer
poems, however, will not bear examination. “Athenia
of Damascus” is pompous nonsense, and “Geraldine”
a most ridiculous imitation of Don Juan, in which
the beauties of the original have been as sedulously
avoided, as the blemishes have been blunderingly
culled. In style, he is, perhaps, the most inflated,
involved, and falsely-figurative, of any of our more
noted poets. This defect, of course, is only fully
appreciable in what are termed his “sustained efforts,”
and thus his shorter pieces are often exceedingly
good. His apparent erudition is mere verbiage,
and, were it real, would be lamentably out of place
where we see it. He seems to have been infected
with a blind admiration of Coleridge—especially of
his mysticism and cant.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i095.jpg' alt='Signature of Henry W. Longfellow' id='iid-0018' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>H. W. Longfellow</span>, (Professor of Moral Philosophy
at Harvard,) is entitled to the first place among
the poets of America—certainly to the first place
among those who have put themselves prominently
forth as poets. His good qualities are all of the highest
order, while his sins are chiefly those of affectation
and imitation—an imitation sometimes verging
upon downright theft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is remarkably good, and is fairly exemplified
in the signature. We see here plain indications
of the force, vigor, and glowing richness of his
literary style; the deliberate and steady <span class='it'>finish</span> of
his compositions. The man who writes thus may
not accomplish much, but what he does, will always
be thoroughly done. The main beauty, or at least
one great beauty of his poetry, is that of <span class='it'>proportion</span>;
another, is a freedom from extraneous embellishment.
He oftener runs into affectation through his endeavors
at simplicity, than through any other cause. Now
this rigid simplicity and proportion are easily perceptible
in the MS., which, altogether, is a very excellent
one.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i096a.jpg' alt='Signature of J. Pierpont' id='iid-0019' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Rev. <span class='sc'>J. Pierpont</span>, who, of late, has attracted
so much of the public attention, is one of the most
accomplished poets in America. His “Airs of Palestine”
is distinguished by the sweetness and vigor
of its versification, and by the grace of its sentiments.
Some of his shorter pieces are exceedingly terse and
forcible, and none of our readers can have forgotten
his Lines on Napoleon. His rhythm is at least equal
in strength and modulation to that of any poet in
America. Here he resembles Milman and Croly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography, nevertheless, indicates nothing
beyond the common-place. It is an ordinary clerk’s
hand—one which is met with more frequently than
any other. It is decidedly <span class='it'>formed</span>; and we have no
doubt that he <span class='it'>never</span> writes otherwise than thus. The
MS. of his school-days has probably been persisted
in to the last. If so, the fact is in full consonance
with the steady precision of his style. The flourish
at the end of the signature is but a part of the writer’s
general enthusiasm.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i096b.jpg' alt='Signature of W. Gilmore Simms' id='iid-0020' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Simms</span> is the author of “Martin Faber,” “Atalantis,”
“Guy Rivers,” “The Partisan,” “Mellichampe,”
“The Yemassee,” “The Damsel of Darien,”
“The Black Riders of the Congaree,” and one
or two other productions, among which we must not
forget to mention several fine poems. As a poet, indeed,
we like him far better than as a novelist. His
qualities in this latter respect <span class='it'>resemble</span> those of Mr.
Kennedy, although he equals him in no particular,
except in his appreciation of the graceful. In his
sense of beauty he is Mr. K.’s superior, but falls behind
him in force, and the other attributes of the author
of Swallow Barn. These differences and resemblances
are well shown in the MSS. That of Mr. S.
has more slope, and more uniformity in detail, with
less in the mass—while it has also less of the picturesque,
although still much. The middle name is
Gilm<span class='it'>o</span>re; in the cut it looks like Gilm<span class='it'>e</span>re.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i097.jpg' alt='Signature of O. A. Brownson' id='iid-0021' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Rev. <span class='sc'>Orestes A. Brownson</span> is chiefly known to
the literary world as the editor of the “Boston Quarterly
Review,” a work to which he contributes, each
quarter, at least two-thirds of the matter. He has
published little in book form—his principal works
being “Charles Elwood,” and “New Views.” Of
these, the former production is, in many respects,
one of the highest merit. In logical accuracy, in comprehensiveness
of thought, and in the evident frankness
and desire for truth in which it is composed, we
know of few theological treatises which can be compared
with it. Its conclusion, however, bears about
it a species of hesitation and inconsequence, which
betray the fact that the writer has not altogether succeeded
in convincing himself of those important truths
which he is so anxious to impress upon his readers.
We must bear in mind, however, that this is the fault
of Mr. Brownson’s subject, and not of Mr. Brownson.
However well a man may reason on the great topics
of God and immortality, he will be forced to admit
tacitly in the end, that God and immortality are things
to be felt, rather than demonstrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On subjects less indefinite, Mr. B. reasons with the
calm and convincing force of a Combe. He is, in every
respect, an extraordinary man, and with the more
extensive resources which would have been afforded
him by early education, could not have failed to bring
about important results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. indicates, in the most striking manner,
the unpretending simplicity, directness, and especially,
the <span class='it'>indefatigability</span> of his mental character. His
signature is more <span class='it'>petite</span> than his general chirography.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i099.jpg' alt='Signature of B. Tucker' id='iid-0022' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Judge <span class='sc'>Beverly Tucker</span>, of the College of William
and Mary, Virginia, is the author of one of the
best novels ever published in America—“George
Balcombe”—although, for some reason, the book
was never a popular favorite. It was, perhaps, somewhat
too didactic for the general taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has written a great deal, also, for the “Southern
Literary Messenger” at different times; and, at
one period, acted in part, if not altogether, as editor
of that Magazine, which is indebted to him for some
very racy articles, in the way of criticism especially.
He is apt, however, to be led away by personal feelings,
and is more given to vituperation for the mere
sake of <span class='it'>point</span> or pungency, than is altogether consonant
with his character as judge. Some five years
ago there appeared in the “Messenger,” under the
editorial head, an article on the subject of the “Pickwick
Papers” and some other productions of Mr.
Dickens. This article, which abounded in well-written
but extravagant denunciation of everything
composed by the author of “The Curiosity Shop,”
and which prophesied his immediate downfall, we
have reason to believe was from the pen of Judge
Beverly Tucker. We take this opportunity of mentioning
the subject, because the odium of the paper
in question fell altogether upon our shoulders, and it
is a burthen we are not disposed and never intended
to bear. The review appeared in March, we think,
and we had retired from the Messenger in the January
preceding. About eighteen months previously,
and when Mr. Dickens was scarcely known to the
public at all, except as the author of some brief tales
and essays, the writer of this article took occasion
to predict, in the Messenger, and in the most emphatic
manner, that high and just distinction which
the author in question has attained. Judge Tucker’s
MS. is diminutive, but neat and legible, and
has much force and precision, with little of the
picturesque. The care which he bestows upon his
literary compositions makes itself manifest also in
his chirography. The signature is more florid than
general hand.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i101a.jpg' alt='Signature of John Sanderson' id='iid-0023' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Sanderson</span>, Professor of the Greek and Latin
languages in the High School of Philadelphia, is well
known as the author of a series of letters, entitled
“The American in Paris.” These are distinguished
by ease and vivacity of style, with occasional profundity
of observation, and, above all, by the frequency of
their illustrative anecdotes, and figures. In all these
particulars, Professor Sanderson is the precise counterpart
of Judge Beverly Tucker, author of “George
Balcombe.” The MSS. of the two gentlemen are
nearly identical. Both are neat, clear and legible.
Mr. Sanderson’s is somewhat the more crowded.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i101b.jpg' alt='Signature of H. F. Gould.' id='iid-0024' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>About Miss <span class='sc'>Gould’s</span> MS. there is great neatness,
picturesqueness, and finish, without over-effeminacy.
The literary style of one who writes thus will always
be remarkable for sententiousness and epigrammatism;
and these are the leading features of Miss
Gould’s poetry.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i102a.jpg' alt='Signature of C. S. Henry' id='iid-0025' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Prof. <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, of Bristol College, is chiefly known
by his contributions to our Quarterlies, and as one of
the originators of the New-York Review, in conjunction
with Dr. Hawks and Professor Anthon. His
chirography is now neat and picturesque, (much resembling
that of Judge Tucker,) and now excessively
scratchy, <span class='it'>clerky</span>, and slovenly—so that it is nearly
impossible to say anything respecting it, except
that it indicates a vacillating disposition, with unsettled
ideas of the beautiful. None of his epistles,
in regard to their chirography, end as well as they
begin. This trait denotes <span class='it'>fatigability</span>. His signature,
which is bold and decided, conveys not the faintest
idea of the general MS.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i102b.jpg' alt='Signature of Emma C. Embury' id='iid-0026' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>Embury</span> is chiefly known by her contributions
to the Periodicals of the country. She is one of the
most nervous of our female writers, and is not destitute
of originality—that rarest of all qualities in a
woman, and especially in an American woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her MS. evinces a strong disposition to fly off at
a tangent from the old formulæ of the Boarding Academies.
Both in it, and in her literary style, it would
be well that she should no longer hesitate to discard
the absurdities of mere fashion.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i103a.jpg' alt='Signature of Wm. Landor.' id='iid-0027' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Landor</span> acquired much reputation as the author
of “Stanley,” a work which was warmly commended
by the press throughout the country. He has also
written many excellent papers for the Magazines.
His chirography is usually <span class='it'>petite</span>, without hair-lines,
close, and somewhat stiff. Many words are carefully
erased. His epistles have always a rigorous formality
about them. The whole is strongly indicative of
his literary qualities. He is an elaborately careful,
stiff, and pedantic writer, with much affectation and
great talent. Should he devote himself ultimately
to letters, he cannot fail of high success.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i103b.jpg' alt='Signature of Eliza Leslie' id='iid-0028' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Miss <span class='sc'>Leslie</span> is celebrated for the homely naturalness
of her stories and for the broad satire of her
comic style. She has written much for the Magazines.
Her chirography is distinguished for neatness
and finish, without over-effeminacy. It is rotund,
and somewhat diminutive; the letters being separate,
and the words always finished with an inward twirl.
She is never particular about the quality of her paper
or the other externals of epistolary correspondence.
From her MSS. in general, we might suppose
her solicitous rather about the effect of her compositions
as a whole, than about the polishing of the
constituent parts. There is much of the picturesque
both in her chirography and in her literary style.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i104.jpg' alt='Signature of Joseph C. Neal' id='iid-0029' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Neal</span> has acquired a very extensive reputation
through his “Charcoal Sketches,” a series of papers
originally written for the “Saturday News,” of this
city, and afterwards published in book form, with illustrations
by Johnston. The whole design of the
“Charcoal Sketches” may be stated as the depicting
of the wharf and street <span class='it'>loafer</span>; but this design has
been executed altogether in caricature. The extreme
of burlesque runs throughout the work, which is, also,
chargeable with a tedious repetition of slang and
incident. The loafer always declaims the same nonsense,
in the same style, gets drunk in the same way,
and is taken to the watch-house after the same fashion.
Reading one chapter of the book, we read all.
Any single description would have been an original
idea well executed, but the dose is repeated <span class='it'>ad nauseam</span>,
and betrays a woful poverty of invention. The
manner in which Mr. Neal’s book was belauded by
his personal friends of the Philadelphia press, speaks
little for their independence, or less for their taste.
To dub the author of these “Charcoal Sketches”
(which are really very excellent police-reports) with
the title of “the American Boz,” is either outrageous
nonsense, or malevolent irony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other respects, Mr. N. has evinced talents which
cannot be questioned. He has conducted the “Pennsylvanian”
with credit, and, as a political writer, he
stands deservedly high. His MS. is simple and legible,
with much space between the words. It has force,
but little grace. Altogether, his chirography is good;
but as he belongs to the editorial corps, it would not
be just to suppose that any deductions, in respect to
character, could be gleaned from it. His signature
conveys the general MS. with accuracy.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i106a.jpg' alt='Signature of Seba Smith' id='iid-0030' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Seba Smith</span> has become somewhat widely celebrated
as the author, in part, of the “Letters of Major
Jack Downing.” These were very clever productions;
coarse, but full of fun, wit, sarcasm and sense.
Their manner rendered them exceedingly popular,
until their success tempted into the field a host of
brainless imitators. Mr. S. is also the author of several
poems; among others, of “Powhatan, a Metrical
Romance,” which we do not very particularly
admire. His MS. is legible, and has much simplicity
about it. At times it vacillates, and appears unformed.
Upon the whole, it is much such a MS. as
David Crockett wrote, and precisely such a one as we
might imagine would be written by a <span class='it'>veritable</span> Jack
Downing; by Jack Downing himself, had this creature
of Mr. Smith’s fancy been endowed with a real
entity. The fact is, that “The Major” is not <span class='it'>all</span>
a creation; at least one half of his character actually
exists in the bosom of his originator. It was the Jack
Downing half that composed “Powhatan.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Judge <span class='sc'>Hopkinson’s</span> hand is forcible, neat, legible,
and devoid of superfluity. The characters have
much slope, and whole words are frequently run together.
The lines are at equal distances, and a
broad margin is at the left of the page, as is the case
with the MSS. of Judge Marshall, and other jurists.
The whole is too uniform to be picturesque. The
writing is always as good at the conclusion, as at the
commencement of the epistles—a rare quality in
MSS., evincing <span class='it'>indefatigability</span> in the writer.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i107.jpg' alt='Signature of Alexander Slidell' id='iid-0032' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant <span class='sc'>Slidell</span>, some years ago, took the additional
name of Mackenzie. His reputation, at one
period, was extravagantly high—a circumstance
owing, in some measure, to the <span class='it'>esprit de corps</span> of the
navy, of which he is a member, and to his private
influence, through his family, with the Review-cliques.
Yet his fame was not altogether undeserved;
although it cannot be denied that his first book,
“A Year in Spain,” was in some danger of being
overlooked by his countrymen, until a benignant star
directed the attention of the London bookseller,
Murray, to its merits. Cockney octavos prevailed;
and the clever young writer who was cut dead in his
Yankee habiliments, met with bows innumerable in
the gala dress of an English <span class='it'>imprimatur</span>. The work
now ran through several editions, and prepared the
public for the kind reception of “The American in
England,” which exalted his reputation to its highest
pinnacle. Both these books abound in racy description;
but are chiefly remarkable for their gross deficiencies
in grammatical construction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieut. Slidell’s MS. is peculiarly neat and even—quite
legible, but altogether too petite and effeminate.
Few tokens of his literary character are to be
found, beyond the <span class='it'>petiteness</span>, which is exactly analogous
with the minute detail of his descriptions.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i108a.jpg' alt='Signature of Francis Lieber' id='iid-0033' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Francis <span class='sc'>Lieber</span> is Professor of History and Political
Economy in the College of South Carolina, and
has published many works distinguished by acumen
and erudition. Among these we may notice a “Journal
of a Residence in Greece,” written at the instigation
of the historian Niebuhr; “The Stranger in
America,” a piquant book abounding in various information
relative to the United States; a treatise on
“Education;” “Reminiscences of an intercourse
with Niebuhr;” and an “Essay on International
Copy-Right”—this last a valuable work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Lieber’s personal character is that of the
frankest and most unpretending <span class='it'>bonhommie</span>, while
his erudition is rather massive than minute. We
may therefore expect his MS. to differ widely from
that of his brother scholar, Professor Anthon; and
so in truth it does. His chirography is careless,
heavy, black, and forcible, without the slightest attempt
at ornament—very similar, upon the whole
to the well-known chirography of Chief Justice Marshall.
His letters have the peculiarity of a wide
margin left at the top of each page.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i108b.jpg' alt='Signature of Sarah J. Hale' id='iid-0034' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>Hale</span> is well known for her masculine style
of thought. This is clearly expressed in her chirography,
which is far larger, heavier, and altogether
bolder than that of her sex generally. It resembles
in a great degree that of Professor Lieber, and is not
easily deciphered.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i109a.jpg' alt='Signature of Edward Everett' id='iid-0035' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Everett’s</span> MS. is a noble one. It has about it
an air of deliberate precision emblematic of the
statesman, and a mingled grace and solidity betokening
the scholar. Nothing can be more legible,
and nothing need be more uniform. The man who
writes thus will never grossly err in judgment, or
otherwise; but we may also venture to say that he
will never attain the loftiest pinnacle of renown.
The letters before us have a seal of red wax, with an
oval device bearing the initials E. E. and surrounded
with a scroll, inscribed with some Latin words which
are illegible.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i109b.jpg' alt='Signature of Robert M. Bird' id='iid-0036' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Bird</span> is well known as the author of “The
Gladiator,” “Calavar,” “The Infidel,” “Nick of
the Woods,” and some other works—Calavar being,
we think, by far the best of them, and beyond doubt
one of the best of American novels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography resembles that of Mr. Benjamin
very closely; the chief difference being in a curl of
the final letters in Dr. B.’s. The characters, too,
have the air of not being able to keep pace with the
thought, and an uneasy want of finish seems to have
been the consequence. A vivid imagination might
easily be deduced from such a MS.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i110a.jpg' alt='Signature of John Neal' id='iid-0037' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>John Neal’s</span> MS. is exceedingly illegible and
careless. Many of his epistles are perfect enigmas,
and we doubt whether he could read them himself
in half an hour after they are penned. Sometimes
four or five words are run together. Any one, from
Mr. Neal’s penmanship, might suppose his mind to
be what it really is—excessively flighty and irregular,
but active and energetic.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i110b.jpg' alt='Signature of C M Sedgwick' id='iid-0038' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The penmanship of Miss <span class='sc'>Sedgwick</span> is excellent.
The characters are well sized, distinct, elegantly but
not ostentatiously formed, and with perfect freedom
of manner, are still sufficiently feminine. The hair-strokes
differ little from the downward ones, and the
MSS. have thus a uniformity they might not otherwise
have. The paper she generally uses is good,
blue, and machine-ruled. Miss Sedgwick’s hand-writing
points unequivocally to the traits of her
literary style—which are strong common sense, and
a masculine disdain of mere ornament. The signature
conveys the general chirography.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i111a.jpg' alt='Signature of J. Fenimore Cooper' id='iid-0039' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Cooper’s</span> MS. is very bad—<span class='it'>unformed</span>, with
little of distinctive character about it, and varying
greatly in different epistles. In most of those before
us a steel pen has been employed, the lines are
crooked, and the whole chirography has a constrained
and school-boyish air. The paper is fine, and of a
bluish tint. A wafer is always used. Without appearing
ill-natured, we could scarcely draw any inferences
from such a MS. Mr. Cooper has seen
many vicissitudes, and it is probable that he has
not always written thus. Whatever are his faults,
his genius cannot be doubted.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i111b.jpg' alt='Signature of J. L. Hawks' id='iid-0040' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Hawks</span> is one of the originators of the “New
York Review,” to which journal he has furnished
many articles. He is also known as the author of
the “History of the Episcopal Church of Virginia,”
and one or two minor works. He now edits the
“Church Record.” His style, both as a writer and
as a preacher, is characterized rather by a perfect
<span class='it'>fluency</span> than by any more lofty quality, and this trait
is strikingly indicated in his chirography, of which
the signature is a fair specimen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This gentleman is the author of “Cromwell,” “The
Brothers,” “Ringwood the Rover,” and some other
minor productions. He at one time edited the “American
Monthly Magazine,” in connection with Mr. Hoffman.
In his compositions for the Magazines, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Herbert</span> is in the habit of doing both them and himself
gross injustice, by neglect and hurry. His longer
works evince much ability, although he is rarely
entitled to be called original. His MS. is exceedingly
neat, clear, and forcible; the signature affording
a just idea of it. It resembles that of Mr. Kennedy
very nearly; but has more slope and uniformity,
with, of course, less spirit, and less of the picturesque.
He who writes as Mr. Herbert, will be found always
to depend chiefly upon his merits of <span class='it'>style</span> for a
literary reputation, and will not be unapt to fall into
a pompous grandiloquence. The author of “Cromwell”
is sometimes wofully turgid.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>Esling</span>, formerly Miss Waterman, has attracted
much attention, of late years, by the tenderness
and melody of her short poems. She deserves <span class='it'>nearly</span>
all the commendation which she has received. Her
MS. would generally be considered beautiful; but
formed, like that of most of her sex, upon a regular
school-model, it is, of course, not in the slightest degree
indicative of character.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i113a.jpg' alt='Signature of E. F. Ellet' id='iid-0043' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>E. F. Ellet</span> has published one or two books,
exclusively of a volume of poems, but is chiefly known
to the literary world by her numerous contributions
to the Magazines. As a translator from the Italian,
she has acquired an enviable reputation. Her hand,
of which the signature above scarcely conveys a full
idea, is clear, neat, forcible and legible; just such a
hand as one would desire for copying MSS. of importance.
We have observed that the writers of such
epistles as those before us, are often known as translators,
but seldom evince high originality or very
eminent talent of any kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge <span class='sc'>Noah</span> has written several plays which took
very well in their time, and also several essays and
other works, giving evidence of no ordinary learning
and penetration on certain topics—chiefly connected
with Israelitish history. He is better known, however,
from the wit and universal <span class='it'>bonhommie</span> of his
editorial paragraphs. His peculiar traits of character
may be traced in his writing, which has about it
a free, rolling, and open air. His lines are never
straight, and the letters taper too much to please the
eye of an artist, and have now and then a twirl, like
the tail of a pig, which gives to the whole MS. an
indescribably quizzical appearance, and one altogether
in consonance with the general notion respecting
the quondam Major, and present Judge, than whom
no man has more friends or fewer enemies.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i114.jpg' alt='Signature of J. G. Palfrey' id='iid-0045' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Professor <span class='sc'>Palfrey</span> is known to the public principally
through his editorship of the “North American
Review.” He has a reputation for scholarship; and
many of the articles which are attributed to his pen
evince that this reputation is well based, so far as the
common notion of scholarship extends. For the rest,
he seems to dwell altogether within the narrow
world of his <span class='it'>own</span> conceptions; imprisoning them by
the very barrier which he has erected against the
conceptions of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. shows a total deficiency in the sense of
the beautiful. It has great pretension—great straining
after effect; but is altogether one of the most
miserable MSS. in the world—forceless, graceless,
tawdry, vacillating and unpicturesque. The signature
conveys but a faint idea of its extravagance.
However much we may admire the mere <span class='it'>knowledge</span>
of the man who writes thus, it will not do to place
any dependence upon his wisdom or upon his taste.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY J. H. DANA.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> is no scenery in England more beautiful than
that to be found in portions of the New Forest. Huge
gray old oaks, gnarled, and twisted, and aspiring to
heaven; deep glens, overshadowed by canopies of
leaves, through which the light but faintly struggles;
vast arcades, stretching far away in the distance, and
buried in religious gloom; wild wood roads, that
wind hither and thither among the giant trees in fanciful
contortions; and open, sunny glades, intersected
by sparkling streamlets, waving with verdant
grass, and now and then disclosing a fairy cottage
nestled in the edge of the forest, are to this day, the
characteristics of this favorite hunting ground of the
conqueror and his immediate successors. There is a
solitude about this old labyrinthine chace, which is
perfectly bewitching. You may travel for miles, in
the more secluded parts of the forest, without meeting
a human being, or seeing the smoke of a single
cottage curling among the foliage; but on every hand
you will behold trees growing in the wildest luxuriance,
and tread on a sward as soft and thick as the
richest velvet. You will, for a space, hear nothing
but the sound of a nut rattling to the ground, or the
song of some wood bird down in a brake; and then
you will rouse the deer from their retreat, a rustle
will be heard down in the under-growth, and you
will catch a sight of the noble herd, perchance, as
they go trotting away into the darker recesses of the
forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the New Forest now, and such it was eight
centuries ago, on a bright sunny morning, towards
the end of summer. The hour was still early, for the
dew yet sparkled in the grass, or pattered down from
the foliage as the wind stirred among the forest branches.
The scene was one of the loveliest the chace afforded—a
bright glade embosomed in the most silent
depths of the forest. The whole of this open space
was carpeted with the thickest and greenest grass,
varying in hue, at every breath of the balmy wind
over the undulated surface. On one side, the glade
was bounded by a gentle elevation, covered with stately
oaks, whose giant branches, spreading out far and
wide, buried their trunks in the obscurity of a constant
twilight—and on the other three sides the
ground either extended itself in a plain, or sloped so
gently off, that the descent was nearly imperceptible.
Thousands of wild flowers spangled the surface of
the glade, some flaunting proudly on the air, and
some modestly hiding under the long grass, yet all
sending forth the most delicious perfume—while innumerable
birds, of every variety of plumage, hopped
from twig to twig, or skimmed across the glade, filling
the air with untold harmonies,—and high in the
heaven, a solitary lark, lingering there long after
his fellows had departed, poured forth his lay with
such sweet, such liquid harmony, that a stranger, unaccustomed
to his song, and unable to distinguish his
tiny form far up in the sunny ether, might well have
fancied those unrivalled notes the breathings of an
unseen cherubim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the scene on which there now gazed two
beings, both beautiful, but one surpassingly so. The
elder of the two might have been one and thirty, and
both his face and figure were moulded in the noblest
style of manly beauty. His broad brow, chiselled
features, and commanding port, bespoke him one born
to rule, although the simple and somewhat mean
garb he wore argued that he was not rich in this
world’s goods. The attire of his companion was richer,
but less gay, and she wore the veil of a novice.
Her face, however, made up in loveliness for whatever
absence of ornament there was in her dress, and
indeed she might well have challenged the world to
produce her rival. The fair delicate skin through
which the blue veins could be seen meandering, the
snowy brow that seemed made for the temple of
the loveliest and purest thoughts, the golden hair
that lay in wreathes upon the forehead, and the blue
eye whose azure depths seemed to conceal mysteries
as pure and rapturing as those of heaven, made up a
countenance of overpowering beauty, even without
that expression, so high and seraphic, which beamed
with her every word, and threw over each lineament
of her face a loveliness almost divine. Her figure
was like that of a sylph, yet full and rounded in every
limb; and beneath her dress peeped forth one of
the most delicate feet that ever trod green sward. She
was perhaps eighteen, though she might have been
younger. She sat now on a low bank, at the very
edge of the forest, while her companion reclined at
her feet, holding one of her tiny hands in his broad
palm, and gazing up into her eyes with a look of the
deepest, yet most respectful passion. Nor were the
maiden’s orbs averted from his gaze, for ever and anon
she would twine her fingers playfully yet half sadly
in his locks, and return his look with all a woman’s
tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sweet one,” said the hunter, as if continuing
a conversation, “I have sometimes, during our
separation for the last six long months, almost desponded,
especially when I heard how urgent my
brother was that you should wed his favorite Warren,
and when I reflected that your aunt, the good abbess
Christiana, was so hostile to my suit. But I did you
injustice, dear one, and thus,” and he kissed the hands
of his companion again and again, “I sue for pardon.
God only knows,” he added in a sadder tone,
“whether I shall ever have my rights. They sneer
at me now as a landless prince, and that purse-proud
Surrey hath no better name for me than Deer’s-foot,
because I am not always able to follow the hunt with
a steed. But so long as thou art true to me, sweet
Maud, all these will be as nothing; and the time may
come when we shall yet be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear not, Beauclerk,” said the princess—for it
was Matilda of Scotland who spoke, and he whom
she addressed was the younger son of the conqueror,
the penniless dependent of him whom men called the
Red King, “fear not—all, as you say, will be well.
I feel it, I know it. Do you believe in presentiments,
dear Henry?” and pushing aside her lover’s thick
locks, she held her hand on his forehead, and looked
with her sunny orbs full into his eyes, as if she would
playfully read his very soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presentiments trouble me not much, despite what
the books say thereof,” answered the frank hunter,
“I trust rather to my sword and my good right arm,
though forsooth, they availed me little when I was
cooped up in St. Michael’s Mount by my two kingly
and loving brothers. Aye! presentiments and prophesies,
and such things, trouble me but little, or I would
e’en have consolation now, in all my troubles, in calling
to mind the words of my father—the saints assoilzie
his memory!—since dying, he said, ‘that I
should be inheritor of all his honors, and should excel
both Robert and William in riches and power.’ By
St. George, the riches had best come soon, for I gave
my last mark away this morning. No, kind Maud,
I place little faith in presentiments. But you sigh.
If it pains you that I credit them not, why, then I
am the most devout believer in all England,” and
again he pressed that fair hand to his lips, “why do
you ask the question?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said the princess, blushing at his eagerness,
“I have had a presentiment that we should
yet be happy, and that full soon. I know not how it
is to happen; but of this I am assured, we shall live
for brighter days. The abbess threatens me with the
veil if I do not wed Surrey, and even now forces me,
in her presence, to wear a tissue of horse-hair; but
though I can as yet see no escape from the alternative,
I am not the less certain that it will never be
mine to choose. So now, despond no more, dear
Beauclerk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, thanks, for your cheering homily,” said
the young prince laughing, for her sanguine words
had affected him with an unusual gaiety. “I can
hunt now with some spirit. Little does Surrey think,
while he is getting ready for the chase and perhaps
sneering at me as a laggard for not being up to set
out with the rest, that I have stolen out into the forest
to meet her for whom he would give the whole of his
broad lands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What answer the princess might have made to this
somewhat vain-glorious speech, we know not, but at
this instant a party appeared on the scene in the guise
of a knight, somewhat advanced in years, and as he
approached hastily, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must forgive me, my dear lady, if I urge you
to take horse. The abbess knows your journey will
have consumed but a day, and that you should have
reached Wilton last night, and I shall have a hard
task to excuse your protracted stay without betraying
you. The men-at-arms are drawn up but a little space
off, and, though they are all my servitors, it is best
that they should know nothing to reveal. The prince
here will understand me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, Sir John; and if he they call Beauclerk
ever attains power, he will not forget those who befriended
the landless prince. I will bring up Maud
in an instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight bowed, and retreated into the wood. A
few parting words were exchanged betwixt the lovers,
a few tears were shed by Maud, which were kissed
off by the prince, and then, with one long, last embrace,
they tore themselves asunder, and in a few
minutes the princess had rejoined her train. Prince
Henry stood looking vacantly in the direction where
she had disappeared, until the sound of her beast’s
tramp had died in the distance, when, slowly mounting
his steed, who had awaited its master in a neighboring
copse, he entered one of the forest roads, and
proceeded leisurely onwards. He had journeyed thus
about half an hour when he heard a hunting horn
sound close by him, and directly he beheld approaching
the gallant array of his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! my good cousin Deer’s-foot, well met,” said
the Earl of Surrey; “we have been looking for you.
I told your friend here, who swore you were yet abed,
that we should meet you afoot in the forest before
the day was over—and thereon we have laid a wager.
I trow we have neither won. It would be but fair to
give you the bet, would it not?” said the gay Earl
with a half concealed sneer, as he glanced from his
own rich suit to the prince’s garb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may both want yet, fair sirs, all you can
spare,” answered the prince; “but let us see who
will be first in at the death. You were always apt at
that, my lord,” and he turned to the royal treasurer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, and shall maintain my reputation, your highness,”
said Breteuil, recollecting he addressed almost
a beggar; “and, if I may judge by your steed, even
against yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see—we shall see,” said the prince.
“I lay you a new steed, my lord, I distance you to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done,” said the treasurer, laughing; “you have
thrown away your horse. But here is the king, and
lo!” and as he spoke the horn announced that a stag
had been roused, “the game is afoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the word the eager sportsmen gave spur to their
steeds, and the cavalcade swept gaily off in the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had a more gallant array than that which
now followed the royal stag, woke up the echoes of
the forest. Knights and squires, priests and pages,
warriors and ecclesiastics, princes of the blood royal
and high officers of state, pressed forward in the
chase, now scouring along the level plain, now dashing
away through the arcades of the forest, and now
plunging recklessly through brake and dell, as the
hounds dogged the flight of the noble animal into his
once secure retreat. Yet it was well worthy of note
how compactly the hunters kept around the king,
none venturing to outstrip him, and only a few of the
oldest maintaining an even rein with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often during the chase the prince and Breteuil
passed and repassed each other, and at every recognition
Henry would gaily remind the treasurer of his
wager. At length, however, the pursuit became
more hot, the king gave rein to his steed and pressed
on, and in passing some broken ground the royal party
became separated, and those who were younger or
better mounted than the rest swept on ahead. Among
these was Prince Henry, who, though his steed was
none of the best, kept up a not ignoble pace, until at
length his arbalast caught against a tree, and he was
nearly thrown from his horse. He checked his steed
at once, and recovered his cross-bow, but the string
was broken, rendering the weapon useless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! My gallant prince,” said the treasurer, as
he swept by; “you can scarcely hit your game now,
even if you keep on. I trow your steed is mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A malison on the string,” said the prince bitterly;
“there is nothing left for me except to sneak
back to Winchester. But, no! I bethink me now
there is a forester’s hut somewhere nigh here. Ah!
yonder is its smoke curling over the tree-tops. I
will hie me there, and get a new string. If the stag
turns at the dell below, he will head up this way, and
I may yet win my wager, for, the saints know, I can
ill afford to lose my only steed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these words the prince again gave spurs to his
horse, and was soon before the forester’s hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! there, within,” he exclaimed; “a string
for the prince. Marry, old mistress, have they never
a keeper here better than you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words were addressed to an old woman who
met him at the threshold of the hut as he dismounted,
and who appeared to be the only human being inhabiting
the cabin. And she was one who might well
occasion the prince’s exclamation of surprise. Her
skin was like that of a corpse; her eyes were sunk
deep into her head; her hair was grizzled and gray;
her long bony fingers might have been those of a
skeleton, and when she spoke, her hollow sepulchral
tones made even the courageous prince shudder. She
seemed to pay no regard to her visitor’s inquiry for
a string, but fastening her basilisk-like eyes upon
him, she said or rather chaunted, in Norman
French, a rude lay, of which the following verses
are a translation:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Hasty news to thee I bring,</p>
<p class='line0'>Henry, thou art now a king;</p>
<p class='line0'>Mark the words, and heed them well,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which to thee in sooth I tell,</p>
<p class='line0'>And recall them in the hour</p>
<p class='line0'>Of thy royal state and power.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>For the space of almost a minute after she had
ceased, the prince gazed speechlessly on this novel
being, awed alike by her strange demeanor, and her
sepulchral eye. Nor were the words she chaunted
without effect on her hearer. It was a superstitious
age, and though few men of his day were less influenced
by the supernatural than Henry, there was
something in the sybil’s look which chilled his heart
with a strange feeling, half fear, half awe. He had
not recovered from his surprise, when a horseman
rushed wildly up to the hut, and the prince had
scarcely recognized one of his warmest friends,
Beaumont, when that gentleman breathlessly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The king is slain!—Tyrell’s arrow glanced
from a bow and struck your royal brother to his
heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words of Beaumont acted on the prince like
the charm which dissipates a spell. He started, as
if aroused from some strange dream, looked a moment
in wild surprise at his companion, and gradually
comprehending the strange and sudden transition
in his fortunes, he sprung with a bound into his
saddle, and plunging his rowels up to the heel in his
horse’s side, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then this is no place for me—follow to Winchester,
Beaumont,—and now for a crown and
Maud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next instant his horse’s hoofs were thundering
across the stones, as he galloped furiously to the
capital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>History relates how he reached Winchester, with
his steed bathed in foam, and, without slackening his
pace, dashed up to the door of the royal treasury, a
few minutes in advance of Breteuil. History also
tells how the energy of the young prince broke
through the meshes of the wily traitor, and secured
for Beauclerk the crown; but it does not add that,
after the unwilling treasurer had surrendered the
keys of the regalia, his new master said, half laughingly
and half ironically, to the haughty peer who
had so often neglected him when only a prince—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my lord! did I not say I would win the
race? I trow your steed is mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discomfited Breteuil bit his lip and was silent,
but that night his best charger was sent to the royal
stables; while the rest of the hunters, who were now
fast pouring in from the chase, with the populace
which at the first news of the Red King’s death had
begun to shout “King Henry,” gathered around their
young monarch and filled the air with their acclamations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maud is right,” said the king to himself, as he
beheld the enthusiasm displayed by his people, “to
say nothing of the old sybil. Ah! what will my
sweet one think when she hears this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three months later and all the chivalry of the realm
was gathered in the church at Westminster, while
the populace without thronged every avenue to that
princely cathedral. Never indeed had a prouder assemblage
met at any royal ceremonial. The church
blazed with jewels. Nobles in their robes of state;
bishops and archbishops with mitre and crozier;
countesses whose beauty out-dazzled their diamonds;
knights and squires and pages of every rank; burghers
with their chains of gold; men-at-arms encased in
steel; halberdiers and archers; yeomen with quarter
staffs, and foresters with arbalasts; men of every
situation of life, and bright ladies, whose loveliness
was beyond compare, were gathered in the gorgeously
ornamented church, amid the waving of banners,
the sound of music, the rustling of costly robes,
and the smoke of ascending incense, to gaze on the
marriage of their monarch to his fair and blushing
bride. And there she stood before the altar in all
her virgin beauty, her fair blue eyes suffused with
tears of joy; while her manly lover stood at her
side, the proudest cavalier in all that bright array.
And when the archbishop ascended the pulpit, and
demanded if any one there objected to the union, the
whole audience shouted aloud “that the matter was
rightly settled;” then again pealed forth the anthem,
and again the incense rose in clouds to the fretted
roof. The music ceased, the words were said, the
crown was placed on the brow of the princess, and
the hunter of the forest, amid the acclamations of his
people, pressed to his heart the <span class='sc'>King’s Bride</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe in presentiments now?” said the
young queen, half laughing, to her royal husband
when they reached the palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a convert to your faith whatever it may be,
sweet one. Nay! you shall preach no sermon over
my retraction, for thus I forbid the homily,” and the
king drew the blushing Maud towards him and fondly
kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many an iron monarch has, since then, sat on the
English throne, and many a fair princess has been
led by her lover to the altar, but never has a happier
or more beautiful pair wore the regal crown in the
realm of our ancestors.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> beautiful towns and villages of Connecticut,
bordering on Long Island sound, are not surpassed in
quiet loveliness by any others in New England. The
loveliest, perhaps, of them all, is Norwalk, situated
in the western part of the State, on a river of the
same name, which flows sweetly along through the
centre of the town. The title, we confess, is neither
euphonious nor romantic: but we would not have it
changed even for the sweetest word that ever passed
human lips. It was given it by the Aborigines on
the day when the territory was first purchased from
them, and refers, if we mistake not, to its extent northward
from the sound, called by the Indians the <span class='it'>North
walk</span>. It is, indeed, one of the most lovely spots in
Nature. Its quiet harbor is studded with verdant
islands of every size and form, while across the green
waters Long Island is seen, its dim outline scarcely
distinguishable from the blue expanse beyond. The
sound through its whole length is spotted with sheets
of snowy canvass spread to catch the breeze, and anon
the majestic steamer, like some huge leviathan, comes
laboring on her way, proudly dashing aside the foaming
waters from her prow, and leaving far behind a
whitened, widening track. But when the Storm King
is abroad, the crested waves pursue each other in
continual chase, and the long, swelling billows break
upon the shore, sending forth their rich music in the
deep organ tones of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the eastern side of the river, and directly opposite
the present steamboat landing, is a large circular
mound, some twenty feet high, and covering a surface
of about an acre. It is perfectly level on the top, and
bordered with large, tall cedars. It is now commonly
known by the inhabitants in the vicinity as <span class='sc'>Old
Fort Point</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a tradition respecting the object and the
erection of this mound, which I have with difficulty
procured, and which maybe interesting to many who
have visited the place, if not to strangers. For its
truth, in all particulars, I will not vouch, but give it
substantially as it has come down to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About two centuries ago, there lived, on the level
country about what is now Fort Point, but what was
then called Naumkeag, one of those large tribes of
native Indians, which, at the time when this land was
first visited by Europeans, were scattered over the
country from the shores of the Atlantic to the great
valley of the west. The Indians had not then been
degraded by their intercourse with the whites. The
peculiarities of their nature had not been modified by
the influence of civilization. Their tastes had not
been pampered, nor their appetites excited by the fatal
“fire water” introduced by their destroyers, nor
their bodily strength wasted by diseases, loathsome
and deadly, and till then unknown among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the feathered flocks of the forest and the finny
tribes of the sea, they derived an ample subsistence;
the shores, too, abounded in shell fish, and the forests
with game, so that want and famine were never
dreamt of by the happy and proud inhabitants of
Naumkeag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many years before the time of this sketch a large
colony separated from the principal tribe and moved
northward, settling themselves in the mountainous regions
of Massachusetts. This colony embraced about
a quarter of the whole tribe at Naumkeag—and being
composed mostly of young men and their wives,
they soon became nearly as powerful as the people
whom they had left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although many miles lay between them, these two
tribes long kept up a friendly intercourse with each
other, and forgot not that they had sprung from the
same common stock. Miles were passed over almost
as easily by those hardy foresters as they are by us at
the present day, even with the help of iron roads and
steam carriages. Great power of endurance was natural
to their constitution, and especially was the fatigue
of a long and rapid journey borne without inconvenience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one of the Wannamoisetts, as those who
had removed from Naumeag now called themselves,
who was more frequent by far in his visits to the sea
shore than any other of his tribe. Every second moon
found him treading the forest with his face toward
the south. His journey usually occupied from two
to three days. Occasionally he remained at Naumkeag
for a week at a time, though for the most part,
his visits were less protracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mononchee had of course some object or incentive
for being thus frequent and regular in his attendance
at the home of his ancestors. His very distant relationship
to the tribe would hardly demand such an
excess of filial affection. The truth was, there was
a magnet of attraction in the person of a young maiden
of Naumkeag, the sister-in-law of the chief, Wappaconet;
and a powerful magnet it was too,—for
there was not another in the whole village that possessed
a brighter eye or a more perfect form. Her
step almost realized the description of the poet,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noalwa was not insensible to the attentions of her
constant swain; on the contrary, his wooings were
quite successful. His bravery and his manly strength—his
tall and well formed person, and flashing eye,
were well calculated to win the admiration, and, in
due course, the affections of the gentle being upon
whom his own desires centered; and the many soft
things that he whispered in her ear, (for even an Indian
<span class='it'>in love</span> can utter the sweetest phrases with a
honied mouth,) found a deep lodgment in her heart.
And it was noticed that when the period of his visits
was near at hand, her step was still lighter than usual,
and her eye danced with a new, but soft fire, though
at such times she spoke less, and seemed thoughtful
but not sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening—it was in the beginning of June, that
season so favorable to young lovers—Mononchee surprised
Noalwa sitting under a large tree close upon
the shore. The hour and the place seemed as if under
the influence of enchantment. The scene was like a
fairy land. The broad sound was spread out before
her, upon whose surface the clear moon shed her softened
rays, which, as from a mirror, were reflected
back on every side, giving to all things around an
unnatural and unearthly brightness. There seemed
a spell upon the air. It stirred not—but hung over
the earth and the sea as if to heal every imperfection
on the face of nature by its bland and genial influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noalwa had not been long there. An unwelcome
intruder had invaded the hour which she had set apart
for solitude and for communion in spirit and in fancy
with her absent but adored lover. The intruder had
hardly left her sight ere he was banished from her
thoughts, and as it was about a week earlier than the
customary time of Mononchee’s coming, she was
thinking how long the days would be till she saw him,
when she felt a warm kiss upon her cheek. She
screamed not—spoke not—for a deep-seated feeling
at her heart told her that those were no forbidden lips
that could kindle such raptures in her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed up at the face and form that was bending
over her with all the fondness of a first love, and
the young Indian placed himself by her side and gently
drew her to his bosom. Then followed a conversation
in low, deep, earnest tones, that both came
from, and reached the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wannamoisett is good—very good, to come
so soon and gladden the heart of Noalwa,” murmured
the girl as he pressed her to his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would not come early and often if Noalwa
loved him?” replied he. “Her beauty is brighter
than the sun! Her eye is clearer and softer than the
moon which leaves a broad trail of light upon the
water. She sings more sweetly than the Tichanet,<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a>
and when she laughs the whole air is full of pleasant
sounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did the Wannamoisett see any of my people as he
came hither?” asked she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None—for I came down by the shore. Ah! yes,
I did see one—Annawon, the Namasket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noalwa hung her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did Mononchee meet him?” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him here!” vehemently replied the warrior,
“here—standing on this very spot. I saw his
hand grasp yours; nay, kneeling at your feet. I saw
his eager look whilst you poured into his ear words
which should have been kept for Mononchee!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so then,” cried the maiden, her lips quivering
with insulted pride, and her heart torn with the
agony which the unjust but perhaps reasonable suspicion
of her lover caused, “be it so! for I told him
to go—ere he told me a tale of love—to his tent
and behold the wasted form and the sunken eye of
Tituba, his wife, once loved and cherished—now
neglected. I told him that I could never be his, and
that any one who suspected Noalwa would so dishonor
herself as to break her faith with another, could
not be worthy of her love. Mononchee suspects her,
and to him let her words be applied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why suffer the Namasket to hold your hand?
Why play with the serpent just ready to strike deep
his fangs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mononchee is a keen-eyed warrior,” said the maid
in irony, “he saw the hawk, but not the wren that
drove <span class='it'>him from her nest</span>. He saw Annawon at the
feet and holding the hand of Noalwa, but did not observe
with what scorn she looked upon him—did not
mark how she spurned and drove him from her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was deceived,” answered the repentant lover;
“Noalwa has a pure heart, and never again will I distrust
her. Seest thou that moon hanging yonder over
the clear water? When it is again round and full, as
it is to-night, Mononchee will come to take Noalwa
for his wife. Will she be ready to go with him then
to dwell where the hills are high and the deer are
plenty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am yours—yours only,” and her blushing face
was hid in his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After sitting for about an hour, the young man
arose. “I must return,” said he, “to my people.
Remember the full moon, Noalwa,” and he strode
rapidly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after the above occurrence the Namaskets
were invited by the Wannamoisetts to partake
of a grand feast of deer and bears’ flesh at their village
in the mountains. Accordingly a large party of
the active men of the tribe started one morning, and
the evening of the next day found them with their
friends at Cohammock. The Wannamoisetts had
made their preparations on a grand, and, for them,
magnificent scale. Piles of plump deer and still
richer bears’ meat lay around, while kettles of dried
sweet corn and beans, of the last year’s growth, were
already simmering over the small fires, that the hard
kernels might become well softened and ready for use
on the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the gray dawn of morning, all was bustle and
activity in the village of Cohammock. The Indian
matrons were early bestirring themselves that nothing
might be left undone to mar the festivities of the
occasion. Innumerable fires were kindled—the wooden
spit and the seething pot, the two indispensable
and almost the only culinary implements in use among
them, were put in requisition. Whilst the preparations
were going slowly on, the men of the tribe as
well as their guests were idling listlessly about, their
appetites every moment rendered sharper by the odor
of the smoking viands that were soon to form their
savory meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And truly the banquet was not unworthy the occasion.
Just as the sun had reached the “middle point
in the heavens,” piles upon piles of boiled and roasted
flesh were spread under the shade of the tall sycamores
that grew undisturbed in all parts of the village.
A large bowl of the finest <span class='it'>succotash</span> was placed
before each guest, and if the quantity eaten be
the standard of quality, never was there served up a
better dinner than was that day disposed of in the
rude village of Cohammock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the repast was finished. Both guests and
entertainers, with a prudence truly commendable, ate
as if expecting a famine for a month, at least, to come,
and nothing remained but to indulge in that supreme
of Indian luxuries, tobacco. Pipes were brought,
but alas! there was not a particle of the weed to be
found. Some miscreant, a fair representative of that
variety of our race at the present day—ever ready to
engender strife, had stolen and destroyed all that was
to be found in the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a deficiency that could be supplied by no
other article. Venison or succotash or any other part
of the edible entertainment could have been dispensed
with, but the burning propensities of an Indian
must be indulged. The Wannamoisetts were as much
mortified as their guests were offended at this unfortunate
occurrence, but it was with difficulty the Namaskets
could be persuaded that it was not an intentional
insult; so jealous were the natives of their
own honor! Contrary to their previous intention,
they left their kinsmen in the early part of the same
afternoon, not caring to remain till morning with
those who had, in their view, been so parsimonious
in their hospitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us return again to the sea shore at Naumkeag.
A month after the feast of Cohammock, a party of
the Wannamoisett warriors were present at a grand
collation, prepared by Wappacowat, the Namasket
chief. Much were they gratified by this expression
of his friendship, for they had always regretted the
affair at their own village, and feared that an open
rupture would be the consequence. They dreaded
this, still cherishing some little spark of fraternal affection
for those whom they had unmeaningly offended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the banquet, so busily were the Wannamoisetts
engaged in despatching the shell and other fish
which their friends had made ready, that they did
not observe that Wappacowat and his followers partook
but sparingly, so that by the time they had eaten
almost to suffocation, and were illy prepared for the
least exertion, the Namaskets had taken only what
was just sufficient to stimulate them for any enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Wappacowat gave the signal to his followers
to bring the calumet, and as he did so, a close
observer might have discovered a gleam of gratified
animosity shoot across his iron features and glisten
in his snaky eye. Quickly moved his warriors, and
the devoted guests half stupified by the vast quantities
of food they had taken, saw the pipes well filled
with the luxurious plant, but did not discover the
tomahawk and the knife which they had concealed
under their deer skin robes. They sat not smoking
long, for suddenly the Namaskets rose and each one
buried his tomahawk into the brain of the Wannamoisett
next him. All—all were slain. So well had
the treacherous, fratricidal plan been matured, that
not a single one was left to carry to the desolate village
of Cohammock the tale of blood and guilt. Ah!
yes, there was one—Mononchee—the betrothed of
Noalwa, who having neglected the feast that he
might spend the time apart with the fair one, came
into the village just as the last reeking scalp had been
torn from the cloven skull. Looking an instant on
the appalling spectacle, he uttered a furious yell and
sprang like a deer towards the river. A dozen tomahawks
flew after him, and as many dark warriors
started in pursuit, but in vain, for with a few powerful
strokes the brave youth gained the opposite bank,
and bounding into the woods, effected his escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were buried on the spot where they fell. Perhaps
no shade of remorse passed over the minds of
the murderers, but they could not leave the victims
there for their flesh to rot and their bones to whiten
in the sun. They were buried several feet below the
surface, and the gloomy shades of night fell thick
around before the last mangled body was hidden from
the sight. And as the rising wind swept through the
thick-topped pines and tall buttonwoods around, it
wailed and sighed mournfully, as if singing a melancholy
dirge over the graves of the gallant dead. And
by the midnight hour it blew in hoarse and awful
tones, and the death shouts and groans of the dead
were heard commingling with the blast; and when
the night was darkest, and all save the growling of
the wind and these unnatural noises, was still, a lurid
flame sprang up from the centre of the spot where
the feast had been, and cast a sickening light on all
things, and the earth opened around, and the bodies
of the Wannamoisett warriors, bloody and mangled
as they were, arose and danced around it, singing
their war songs in unearthly tones, together with their
wild requiem for the dead. Ghastly and horrible they
looked, and as they danced, the blood flowed from
their opening wounds, till it reached the strange fire,
which instantly shot up in one lurid column of flame
till it attained the blackened clouds, when it disappeared
as suddenly as it had burst forth; the spectral
revellers sank back again into their fresh graves, and
all was dark and silent as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the morning broke the Namaskets beheld
a spectacle scarcely less hideous than that of the
preceding night. Their victims had been buried, as
their custom was, in a sitting posture, and during the
night they had all risen, so that their heads were fully
visible above the surface of the ground. The bloody
mark of the tomahawk was still there, and every
scalp was torn off—and the eyeballs, projecting far
from the sockets, were fixed and glassy, but of a burning
red,—glowing like living fire. And from them
rays of dingy red streamed all over the village,—and
wherever one of the murderers went, those rays followed
him, and pierced him, and seemed as if they
were burning out his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reckless with fear and rage the murderers tore the
bodies up from the ground and dug the graves still
deeper and again they placed them in. But at midnight
the red flame burst forth and the tempest howled
fearfully. The phantom forms sprung up as before,
and this time their flesh, from their shoulders
downward, dropped off and was consumed by the fire,
and a dense smoke arose, and a red cloud slowly
gathered in the air, and hovered round and hung over
the spot like a minister of vengeance. And in the
morning their gory heads and glaring eyes had again
struggled up above the surface. And when the fratricides
saw them, a deadly terror crept over them
and the demon of remorse began to prey upon their
souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third night the scene was changed. The
moon did not set at her accustomed hour, but hung
just above the horizon, red as a sea of blood. And
in the midst of the fire that shot forth from the earth
at midnight, a form was seen like that of Wappacowat,
the chief. But the ghostly images were there
again, and they gathered round the form in the centre,
and with their skeleton fingers tore off its flesh
as fast as it was seared in the fire, and ground it in
their teeth with ravenous appetite. When in the
morning the dismayed villagers sought their chief
they found him not, but tied to a stake where the
midnight revel had been held was a skeleton, the
bones all picked clean except the head, which had
been cloven with a tomahawk, and from it the scalp
was also torn, and in its features, distorted as if they
had stiffened under the keenest tortures, they recognized
the countenance of their king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dismay sat upon every guilty face, and a sullen
gloom enshrouded every heart. The tribe finding it
useless to bury deeper the bodies of their slain kinsmen
now began to build over them—but every night
one of their number disappeared, and in the morning
his fleshless bones were found tied to the fatal stake;
and still the heads rose, but every day there was one
less than before. Then the dreadful truth flashed
upon them that one of their own number must die in
that fearful manner, for every one of the Wannamoisetts
they had slain. As the number of their dead
increased, which it did by one for every midnight
hour, so did the number of spectre heads diminish.
One murdered spirit was every night appeased, and
appeared no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still they kept on building that huge pile, and the
dreadful occupation to which they clung as affording
the only ray of hope that they might be delivered
before their turn should come round, so wrought upon
the guilty ones that they soon became almost as ghostly
as the phantoms of the night which tortured them.
But they faltered not in their task. Every day the
heads were covered and every morning they were
found in sight. And on the seventieth morning that
mound was far higher than it now stands. There was
then but one head remaining, for just seventy of the
Wannamoisetts had been slain and just seventy were
the murderers. At midnight of that day the strange
revel was, for the last time, visible, for when the skeleton
of Mononton, the last and most bloody of the
fratricides was found, the last head had disappeared
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the tribe left soon after in search
of a more auspicious residence. Since the treacherous
act of their brethren, famine had weakened them
and the terrible plague laid many of their forest children
low. But wherever they wandered, the curse
of the Great Spirit followed them, and they dwindled
away until finally there was no place left for them on
the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One fair evening in the next summer, two forms sat
upon the very mound which forms the principal subject
of this tale. One was a female of fairy proportions,
and she looked abroad over the landscape with
the eye of one to whom its beauties were familiar.
Her companion’s face was buried in his hands, and
his whole frame shook as if the recollection of some
terrible scene were passing over his memory. And
as the eye of Noalwa rested on him she, too, divining
his thoughts, shuddered, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mononchee! let us go hence, never again to return!
I cannot bear to look upon these scenes where
my people lived and where yours so sadly perished.
These trees that we have planted around the mound
which covers them will bear witness that their memory
is still dear to us. Let us go, Mononchee!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went to dwell with those that were left of his
people. Many and bright were their days. Plenty
surrounded them. The tribe grew again and Mononchee
became their chief. The trees which he planted
around “Fort Point” sprang forth and flourished
luxuriantly, and the large junipers that still remain
are doubtless descended from that parent stock. But
scarcely any other green thing will grow there; it
seems a devoted place. Devoted let it be; sacred forever
to the shades of those who are sleeping in its
bosom.</p>

<div><h1><a id='spo'></a>Sports and Pastimes.—THE FOWLING-PIECE.</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LOCK—THE PERCUSSION SYSTEM—TRIGGERS—WADDING—AMMUNITION, ETC.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> flint and steel lock, like the matchlock, has had its
day; and the one is as likely as the other to supersede the
detonator. There were some sportsmen who long retained
the flint in preference to the copper-cap. Their partiality
for the old system arose from their inability to depart from
the manner of taking aim to which they had been accustomed—they
fired too forward! It was said, too, that a
barrel fired by a detonating lock, did not throw shot so efficiently
as the other. That objection is now obviated
by making barrels perfectly cylindrical throughout the
whole length of the tube. We prefer the copper-cap
lock for its simplicity, to any other system of firing by
percussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bad lock, in these <span class='it'>march-of-improvement</span> days, is rarely
fixed to a gun. Since the use of detonators has become general,
the quality of the lock is not of so much consequence
to the sportsman as it was previously. The quickness of
firing with the old flint and steel locks depended so much on
the workmanship of the lock, that a properly-tempered and
well-filed one was invaluable. The introduction of detonators
has by no means improved the quality of the workmanship
of the lock—it has rather deteriorated it. The fact is,
the master gunmakers, finding the lock not so much looked
at as formerly, are become indifferent to obtaining the
assistance, or unwilling to incur the expense of first-rate
workmen. The hardening and filing of a lock in an artist-like
manner, requires no common skill. The best locks
ever turned out were those made on the flint and steel principle,
at the time when detonators first came into vogue;
the smartness with which the percussion locks fired, obliged
the makers of the flint and steel locks to bestow double diligence
and labor on their work, conscious that a rival was in
the field with whom it required no ordinary pains to compete.
Flint locks, whether as applied to the fowling-piece
or the musket, will soon be forgotten, or remembered only
to give a romantic interest to some tale of other times, as the
arbalast and long-bow serve only to remind us of our Norman
and Saxon ancestors! It requires some mechanical
knowledge and some experience, to decide on the merit of a
lock. The vulgar method of trying one is this:—The operator
draws back the hammer with his thumb, not touching
the trigger with his finger, and if the works in the interior
catch and snap smartly at the half-way, and when the hammer
is drawn back, he may rely on the main-spring being
sufficiently strong and free to fire the caps: then, with his
thumb still on the hammer, he draws the trigger and lets the
hammer glide slowly down upon the pivot. With a little
practice he will be able, in some degree, to discriminate between
a good lock and a bad one. To prove the difference
in quality, he should take up a well-finished lock; that is,
one of hard material, well filed, and having springs of a
suitable and corresponding strength, and compare it with an
inferior lock; by a nice touch he will perceive the difference:
the hammer of the former slides backwards and forwards
with a smooth, even force; whilst that of the latter
runs rough and gritty, as if clogged with sand. If this somewhat
uncertain mode of trial serve no other purpose, it will
enable the shooter, when he takes up a gun that has been
used since being cleaned, to discover whether the lock is
sufficiently free from rust and dirt as to be fit for the day’s
service; for most assuredly, if the lock be clogged, when
thus worked backwards and forwards, it will not snap, or in
sporting phrase <span class='it'>talk</span>; and in that case it would be unsafe to
use it. A detonating lock that will bear this trial, and will
invariably fire the cap, may be pronounced quite good
enough for any sporting purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The triggers should be what are technically termed <span class='it'>box-triggers</span>,
and should be taken from the stock and cleaned at
least once during the season, and oftener if very much exposed
to dust, rain, or a damp atmosphere. They should
be adjusted with scrupulous nicety, so as to require only a
slight touch to draw them: they should not, indeed, fire as
easily as the hair-triggers of duelling pistols, but should be
fixed so firmly as that the sportsman should not be liable to
discharge his piece, while bringing it up to his shoulder
cocked, with his finger upon one of the triggers. The triggers
may sometimes be regulated by filing, hardening, or
softening the scear spring, or filing the wedge-like part of
the scear which falls into the notches of the tumbler: and
sometimes it is necessary to file that part of the trigger
which comes in contact with the scear, but this operation
requires to be carefully performed. A valuable lock should
not be placed in the hands of an unskilful workman for the
apparently trifling purpose of regulating the triggers, nor
yet for any other purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wadding we should recommend is that made of felt,
and anointed with some chemical preparation. We are not
sure that this is the very best description of wadding, but
we know of none better. New waddings are constantly invented.
The metallic wadding, concave wadding, punched
cards, or punched hat wadding, are any of them good, as
regards shooting. The chief reason why we bestow a preference
on the anointed wadding is, because the barrel is
kept less foul, and may be fired so many times oftener without
requiring cleaning, than when any other description of
wadding with which we are acquainted is used. We are
not partial to a tight wadding, but it should fit so that when
the barrel is clean and smooth within, the charge will not
stir. There is little fear of the charge stirring after a barrel
has been fired a few times, as the place where the leading
or foulness accumulates in greatest quantity is just above
where the charge of shot lies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerable improvement has been made in copper-caps
since they were first introduced. The composition in all of
them is now good; that which possesses the anti-corrosive
principle is perhaps best. There is much difference in the
copper of which they are made, but that is of little consequence
when good locks with concave or well shielded hammers
are used, otherwise those made of bad copper are said
to be dangerous. We never heard of an accident from them.
The shooter should be particular in procuring copper-caps
of a proper size; for if they do not fit the pivots, considerable
inconvenience will be experienced. When too small,
they will not explode; and when too large, the cap on the
second pivot is apt to fly off when the first barrel is fired.
The shooter will find it convenient to carry a quantity of
caps loose in his waistcoat pocket, with a reserve in a box
(a metal box water-tight is best) to have recourse to should
those in his pocket become wet. He should take care that
there be nothing in his pocket to choke the caps; and by
way of precaution, he should, before putting a cap on the
pivot, see that there be no dirt in the cap, and that it be
perfect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best powder does not soil the gun so much as inferior
powder. After using good powder, a redness will be observed
round the orifice of the pivot. After using coarse
powder, a white or black appearance will present itself.
The purer the powder is, the oftener may a barrel be fired
without requiring to be cleaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the measure on the flask is regulated as it ought to
be, it will hold the requisite charge for a clean barrel on a
warm dry day. It behoves the shooter, then, when the atmosphere
is moist and the wind boisterous, to increase the
charge of powder in each barrel in a trifling degree. However
stormy the day may be, the shooter may prevent the
particles of powder from being blown away while he is
charging; but he cannot prevent them adhering to the damp
leaded interior of the barrels. Indeed, if the barrels be
damp, as they cannot fail to be if the air be so, and there be
no wind at all, they cannot be held quite perpendicular, so
that the whole charge of powder shall find its way to the
breech. One-fifth of the charge will sometimes adhere.
Doubtless, when tight wadding is used, the whole, or nearly
the whole, of the charge finds its way to the bottom: but in
what state? A portion of it is wet!—and the result is, that,
when the piece is discharged, only four-fifths ignite!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fowling-piece should be put by clean, oiled, and the
barrels corked or stopped, and with the hammers upon the
pivots. It should be kept in a cloth or woolen case, in a dry
room, and, when not in constant use, occasionally rubbed
with linen dipped in olive oil. The inside of the barrel
should be frequently oiled, the oil being immediately wiped
out with a dry cloth wrapped round the cleaning rod.
Neat’s-foot oil is best for the lock, and linseed oil is recommended
for the stocks, but it is so offensive that we prefer
olive oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Large-grained powder is generally stronger than small-grained.
It is well to be cautious that the grain is not so
large as not to fill the nipple freely, or misfires will be the
consequence. Powder which suits one gun may not suit
another; the larger the bore of the gun, the larger should be
the grain of the powder. An instrument for trying the
strength of powder should not be trusted to: the best trial
is with the gun in which the powder is intended to be used,
and there can be no better target for trying the comparative
strength of different powders, than an unbound book fixed
firmly against something solid.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHARGING THE FOWLING-PIECE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is not usual to charge the gun until arriving at the
shooting ground. When there, however advisable on the
score of caution it may be, flashing off a quantity of powder
to clear out, dry, and warm the gun before loading, has certainly
a cockney appearance; the more sportsman-like practice
is,—the party having reliance on the person who cleans
his gun,—merely to permit the ramrod to fall lightly to the
bottom of each barrel. The barrels are then held as perpendicularly
as possible while the powder is poured in, so
that nearly the whole charge may reach home, and not adhere
in its descent. The barrel is then tapped with the ramrod,
or the gun slightly shook against the foot, that powder
may find its way into the pivots,—that is the more necessary
when coarse-grained powder is used. A wadding is
then gently pressed down. The shot is next poured in, and
a slight shake of the gun in an upward direction causes it
to lie evenly;—a wadding is pressed upon it. The shooter
next removes the remains of the caps, and looks whether
the powder has found its way to the orifice of the pivots, and
if it has, he places fresh caps on; if powder is not visible at
the orifice of the pivots, he removes any obstacle with a
pricker, and contrives to push down a few grains of powder.
It is very material to attend to this point, to prevent
miss-fires.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE WIRE-CARTRIDGE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The wire-cartridge was invented, in 1828, by Mr. Jenour.
It consists of a cylindrical case or network of wire, the
meshes of which are somewhat more than an eighth of an
inch square; at the lower end the wire partially closes; the
wire case is then enveloped in fine paper, and at the upper
end a cork wadding, cut so as to fit the gauge of the gun, is
affixed, the case is then filled with shot and bone dust. The
first cartridges made, though ingenious in construction, were
defective in operation. It was a matter of no ordinary difficulty
to fabricate them in such a manner that the shot
should leave the case at the precise distance required. This
at first could not be done so that they might be trusted in
every instance; every alternate cartridge might fire well,
but the rest would fire irregularly, being liable to ball,—that
is, the shot would not leave the case until fifty or sixty
yards from the gun, and such cartridges were, of course, not
only useless but dangerous. They have been from time to
time improved, and almost every difficulty has been overcome.
The sporting cartridges now made never ball, they
act with a considerable degree of precision and certainty,
and that they may be safely trusted may be inferred from
the fact that they are often preferred by persons engaged in
pigeon matches. Various materials were used experimentally
to fill up the interstices between the pellets, but nothing
seems to answer so well as the material now used. Another
difficulty in their construction presented itself. It was requisite
to accommodate them to the various methods of
boring used by different gunmakers, and the unequal length
of barrels, the object in view being to produce a cartridge
that would suit all barrels of the same gauge, and this has
been in a great measure, if not wholly, accomplished. The
liability to ball, notwithstanding various improvements made
in them, was not effectually obviated for many years, during
which they were tried, and in many instances prematurely
condemned, either from real defects, or from the parties
not knowing how to use them. They were not brought to
perfection until the year 1837.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wire-cartridges possess two principal advantages over
loose shot; they are propelled with greater velocity, and
thrown more evenly. A loose charge is always thrown in
patches; the shots of a cartridge, as seen on a target, are
comparatively equi-distant from each other.</p>

<div><h1><a id='rev'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Guy Fawkes; or The Gunpowder Treason. An Historical
Romance. By</span> <span class='sc'>William Harrison Ainsworth</span>,
<span class='it'>Author of “The Tower of London,” “Jack Sheppard,”
&amp;c. Philadelphia. Lea and Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What Mr. William Harrison Ainsworth had been doing
before he wrote “Rookwood” is uncertain; but it seems to
us that he made his literary <span class='it'>début</span> with that work. It was
generally commended; but we found no opportunity of
perusing it. “Crichton” followed, and this we read; for
our curiosity was much excited in regard to it by certain
discrepancies of critical opinion. In one or two instances it
was unequivocally condemned as “flat, stale and unprofitable,”
although, to be sure, the critics, in these one or two
instances, were men of little note. The more prevalent idea
appeared to be that the book was a miracle of wit and wisdom,
and that Ainsworth who wrote “Crichton,” was in
fact Crichton <span class='it'>redivivus</span>. We have now before us a number
of a Philadelphia Magazine for the month of April,
1840, in which the learned editor thus speaks of the work
in question—“Mr. Ainsworth is a powerful writer; his
‘Crichton’ <span class='it'>stands at the head of the long list of English
novels—unapproachable and alone</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This great glory is
fairly Mr. Ainsworth’s due, and in our humble opinion, <span class='it'>the
fact is incontrovertible</span>.” Upon a perusal of the novel so
belauded, we found it a somewhat ingenious admixture of
pedantry, bombast, and rigmarole. No man ever read
“Crichton” through twice. From beginning to end it is
one continued abortive effort at effect. The writer keeps us
in a perpetual state of preparation for something magnificent;
but the something magnificent never arrives. He is
always saying to the reader, directly or indirectly, “<span class='it'>now</span>, in
a <span class='it'>very</span> brief time, you shall see what you shall see!” The
reader turns over the page in expectation, and meets with
nothing beyond the same everlasting assurance:—another
page and the same result—another and still the same—and
so on to the end of the performance. One cannot help fancying
the novelist in some perplexing dream—one of those
frequently recurring visions, half night-mare half asphyxia,
in which the sufferer, although making the most strenuous
efforts to <span class='it'>run</span>, finds a walk or a crawl the <span class='it'>ne plus ultra</span> of
his success in locomotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plot is monstrously improbable, and yet not so much
improbable as inconsequential. A German critic would say
that the whole is excessively <span class='it'>ill-motivert</span>. No one action
follows necessarily upon any one other. There is, at all
times, the greatest parade of <span class='it'>measures</span>, but measures that
have no comprehensible result. The author works busily
for a chapter or two with a view of bringing matters in train
for a certain end; and then suffers this end to be either
omitted—unaccomplished—or brought to pass by accidental
and irrelevant circumstances. The reader of taste very
soon perceives this defect in the conduct of the story, and,
ceasing to feel any interest in marches and countermarches
that promise no furtherance of any object, abandons himself
to the investigation of the page only which is immediately
before him. Despairing of all amusement from the <span class='it'>construction</span>
of the book, he falls back upon its immediate
descriptions. But, alas, what is there here to excite any
emotion in the bosom of a well-read man, beyond that of
contempt? If an occasional interest is aroused, he feels it
due, not to the novelist, but to the historical reminiscences
which even that novelist’s inanity cannot render altogether
insipid. The turgid pretension of the style annoys, and the
elaborately-interwoven pedantry irritates, insults, and disgusts.
He must be blind, indeed, who cannot understand
the great pains taken by Mr. Ainsworth to interlard the book
in question with second-hand hits of classical and miscellaneous
erudition; and he must be equally blind who cannot
perceive that <span class='it'>this</span> is the chicanery which has so impressed
the judgment, and dazzled the imagination of such critics
as he of the aforesaid Magazine. We know nothing at all
of Mr. Ainsworth’s scholarship. There are some very
equivocal blunders in “Crichton,” to be sure; but <span class='it'>Ainsworth</span>
is a classical name, and we must make <span class='it'>very</span> great
allowances for the usual errors of press. We say, however,
that, from all that appears in the novel in question, he may
be as really ignorant as a bear. True erudition—by
which term we here mean only to imply much diversified
reading—is certainly discoverable—is positively indicated
only in its ultimate and total <span class='it'>results</span>. We have observed
elsewhere, that the mere grouping together of fine things
from the greatest multiplicity of the rarest works, or even
the apparently natural inweaving into any composition of
the sentiments and manner of these works, is an attainment
within the reach of every moderately-informed, ingenious,
and not indolent man, having access to any ordinary collection
of good books. Of all vanities the vanity of the unlettered
pedant is the most sickening, and the most transparent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ainsworth having thus earned for himself the kind of
renown which “Crichton” could establish with the rabble,
made his next appearance before that rabble with “Jack
Sheppard.” Seeing what we have just seen, we should by
no means think it wonderful that this romance threw into
the greatest astonishment the little critics who so belauded
the one preceding. They could not understand it at all.
They would not believe that the same author had written
both. Thus they condemned it in loud terms. The Magazine
before alluded to, styles it, in round terms, “the most
corrupt, flat, and vulgar fabrication in the English language
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a disgrace to the literature of the day.” Corrupt
and vulgar it undoubtedly is, but it is by no means so <span class='it'>flat</span>
(if we understand the critic’s idea of the term) as the
“Crichton” to which it is considered so terribly inferior.
By “<span class='it'>flat</span>” we presume “uninteresting” is intended. To
us, at least, no novel was less <span class='it'>interesting</span> than “Crichton,”
and the only interest which it <span class='it'>could</span> have had for any reader
must have arisen from admiration excited by the apparently
miraculous <span class='it'>learning</span> of the plagiarist, and from the
air of owlish profundity which he contrives to throw
over the work. The interest, if any, must have had regard
to the author and not to his book. Viewed as a work
of art, and without reference to any supposed moral or immoral
tendencies, (things with which the critic has nothing
to do) “Jack Sheppard” is by no means the <span class='it'>very</span> wretched
composition which some gentlemen would have us believe.
Its condemnation has been brought about by the revulsion
consequent upon the exaggerated estimate of “Crichton.”
It is altogether a much better book than “Crichton.” Although
its incidents are improbable—(the frequent miraculous
escapes of the hero, for instance, without competent
means) still they are not, as in “Crichton,” at the same time
inconsequential. Admitting the facts, these facts hang together
sufficiently well. Nor is there any bombast of style;
this negative merit, to be sure, being no merit of the author’s,
but an enforced one resulting from the subject. The chief
defect of the work is a radical one, the nature and effect of
which we were at some pains to point out in a late notice of
Captain Marryatt’s “Poacher.” The story being, no doubt,
written to order, for Magazine purposes, and in a violent
hurry, has been scrambled through by means of <span class='it'>incident</span>
solely. It is totally wanting in the <span class='it'>autorial comment</span>. The
writer never pauses to speak, in his own person, of what is
going on. It is possible to have too much of this comment;
but it is far easier to have too little. The most tedious books,
<span class='it'>ceteris paribus</span>, are those which have none at all. “Sir
Charles Grandison,” “Clarissa Harlowe,” and the “Ernest
Maltravers” of Bulwer embody instances of its superabundance.
The genius of the author of “Pelham” is in nothing
more evident than in the interest which he has infused into
some of his late works <span class='it'>in spite</span> of their ultra-didacticism.
The “Poacher” just mentioned, and “The Arabian Nights”
are examples of deficiency in the commenting principle,
and are both intolerably tedious <span class='it'>in spite</span> of their rich variety
of incident. The <span class='it'>juste milieu</span> was never more admirably
attained than in De Foe’s “Robinson Crusoe” and in the
“Caleb Williams” of Godwin. This latter work, from the
character of its incidents, affords a fine opportunity of contrast
with “Jack Sheppard.” In both novels the hero escapes
repeatedly from prison. In the work of Ainsworth the
escapes are merely narrated. In that of Godwin they are
<span class='it'>discussed</span>. With the latter we become at once absorbed in
those details which so manifestly absorb his own soul. We
read with the most breathless attention. We close the book
with a real regret. The former puts us out of all patience.
His marvels have a nakedness which repels. Nothing he
relates seems either probable or possible, or of the slightest
interest, whether the one or the other. His hero impresses
us as a mere chimæra with whom we have no earthly concern,
and when he makes his final escape and comes to the
gallows, we would feel a very sensible relief, but for the
impracticability of hanging up Mr. Ainsworth in his stead.
But if “Jack Sheppard” is a miserably inartistical book,
still it is by no means so utterly contemptible and silly as
the tawdry stuff which has been pronounced “<span class='it'>the best of
English novels, standing at the head of the long list unapproachable
and alone!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of “The Tower of London” we have read only some
detached passages—enough to assure us, however, that the
“<span class='it'>work</span>,” like Yankee razors, has been manufactured merely
“to sell.” “Guy Fawkes,” the book now lying before us,
and the last completed production of its author, is positively
beneath criticism and beneath contempt. The design of Mr.
Ainsworth has been to fill, for a certain sum of money, a
stipulated number of pages. There existed a necessity of
<span class='it'>engaging</span> the readers whom especially he now addresses—that
is to say the lowest order of the lettered mob—a necessity
of enticing them into the commencement of a perusal.
For this end the title “Guy Fawkes or The Gunpowder
Plot” was all sufficient, at least within the regions of Cockaigne.
As for fulfilling any reasonable expectations, derived
either from the <span class='it'>ad captandum</span> title, or from his own notoriety
(we dare not say reputation) as a novelist—as for exerting
himself for the permanent or continuous amusement of
the poor flies whom he had inveigled into his trap—all this,
with him, has been a consideration of no moment. He had
a <span class='it'>task</span> to perform, and not a duty. What were his readers
to Mr. Ainsworth?—“What Hecuba to him, or he to
Hecuba?” The result of such a state of affairs is self-evident.
With his <span class='it'>best</span> exertions, in his earliest efforts, with
all the goadings of a sickening vanity which stood him well
instead of nobler ambition—with all this, he <span class='it'>could</span> do—he
<span class='it'>has done</span>—but little; and without them he has now accomplished
exactly nothing at all. If ever, indeed, a novel were
<span class='it'>less</span> than nothing, then that novel is “Guy Fawkes.” To
say a word about it in the way of serious criticism, would
be to prove ourselves as great a blockhead as its author.
<span class='it'>Macte virtute</span>, my dear sir—proceed and flourish. In the
meantime we bid you a final farewell. Your next volume,
which will have some such appellation as “The Ghost of
Cock-Lane,” we shall take the liberty of throwing unopened

1842. Carey and Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume of “The Gift” is superior to any yet published.
Mrs. Embury has an entertaining story, and Miss
Leslie’s account of a “Family that Didn’t take Boarders”
is also quite amusing. Mr. Simms has a well narrated tale—Mr.
Seba Smith has another—Professor Frost another—Mrs.
Ellet, also, and the author of “A New Home.” We
ourselves have one which is not ended so well as it might
be—a good subject spoiled by hurry in the handling. The
poetry, in general, is insipid. Mrs. Sigourney has not done
herself justice. Lieut. G. W. Patten, U. S. A. has three
effusions, neither of which do credit to the Annual. This
gentleman, who writes frequently, and should therefore
write well, is singularly remiss in his metaphors, and often
grievously deficient in his grammar. What does he mean, at

<p class='pindent'>This is surely a most singular instance of metaphor run
mad! Here are three conflicting images at one time in the
brain of the poet. By the word “wings” the reader is made
to understand the prosopopeia of the storm as a <span class='it'>bird</span>; by
“thunder” (a <span class='it'>natural</span> accompaniment of tempests) he is
brought back to the impersonified storm; by “fretting” he
is left in no doubt that the writer’s ideas are running upon a
<span class='it'>horse</span>—and all this in the compass of one line and a half!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Stanzas” by Park Benjamin have a rich simplicity
which of all literary qualities is the most difficult of attainment,
and of all merits the most uncertain of appreciation;
but we are sorry to say that they are the <span class='it'>only</span> good verses
in the volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The engravings are very fine. We will speak of them
briefly one by one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Country Girl,” by Cheney from Sully, is a <span class='it'>truthful</span>
picture. The design is perfect. The only fault of the execution
lies in the undue breadth of the face; this defect would
be remedied by deepening the shade beneath the left ear.
The work of the engraver is well done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vignette Head,” by Cheney from Sully—one of the
latter’s favorite heads—the face that of a pouting hoyden.
The hair is beautifully <span class='it'>massed</span>. The <span class='it'>vignetting</span> is carried
too low as regards the bosom, from which half an inch should
be taken off at bottom, or otherwise some lines of shading
introduced to relieve it of its blank appearance. The arm
is execrable—the hand worse—both are too massive and
sinewy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dulcinea,” by Cheney from Leslie. No fault can be
found with this picture, which is admirable in every respect.
The right arm, in especial, is exquisitely rounded and
foreshortened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tough Story” by J. J. Pease, from W. S. Mount.
Mr. Mount’s merits are those of acute observation and fidelity.
These merits, although not of the highest order, have
the advantage of being universally appreciable. This is an
advantage which he secures—<span class='it'>clinches</span>—by dealing only
in homely subjects. If he has ideality (a question which as
yet we have had no means of deciding) and would employ
his peculiar talents upon loftier themes, he might attain a
very desirable eminence indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could be more true to nature than the picture
before us; but the painter has sacrificed to this truth (at
some points) artistical effects of superior value. What can
be more displeasing, for example, than the unrelieved nakedness
of the wall in the back ground, or the situation of the
group precisely in the centre of the design, or, especially,
than the tall regular stove pipe, running up parallel with
the back of the standing figure, and dividing the apartment
exactly in two?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Gipsy,” by Cheney from Sully, is altogether out of
drawing as regards the face, which is, again, too broad to
the left. This is a very usual error in side faces. The fingers
are badly engraved, particularly those of the right hand,
which look as if covered with a net or pic-nic glove. The
foliage in this picture is not very well executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Sled” by W. E. Tucker, from Chapman, is a most
effective design, evincing the well-educated artist. The
idea of rapid motion is skilfully embodied in the countenance
of the boy, in the peculiar falling curve of the hill, and exquisitely
<span class='it'>corroborated</span> in the whirl of the clouds. This is
the true artistical keeping. The limbs of the boy are too
small for his head and body, and the left hand appears to
have been cut from a turnip. This latter defect is chargeable
to the engraver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Raffle” by A. Lawson from Mount. This is another
of Mr. Mount’s idiosyncrasies, and is absolute perfection <span class='it'>in
its way</span>. The defects of the work (considered as a mere
picture) which we pointed out in the “Tough Story,” are
not observable here. The grouping of the figures and the
arrangement of the design generally, are as admirable as
the varied expression of the Yankee faces. The light, however,
is too equally disposed about the room, and, in especial,
upon the three middle personages. It is difficult, moreover,
to imagine these three persons so illumined, and the back of
the foreground figure at the same time so fully in shade.
These are petty objections—but it is right they should be
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Portia,” by Forrest from Sully, is an engraving in which
the mere mechanism is excellent; and, in fact, the work is,
upon the whole, highly creditable to Mr. Forrest. The
hands, however, are badly done; the left especially. Some
knowledge of drawing is absolutely essential in one who
copies. This knowledge cannot be supplied by even Chinese
fidelity in depicting dot for dot and line for line. The
picture, altogether, we prefer to any in the book. Were we
in the habit of purchasing paintings this “Portia” by Sully
is the only one here which we would purchase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The paper of “The Gift” for 1842 does not seem to us sufficiently
good. The binding is certainly magnificent, but
would have been vastly improved by the use of a thicker
board.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The reputation of the elder D’Israeli as scholar and philosopher
is at least as well founded as that of any man of
his age. He has given to the world a series of <span class='it'>peculiar</span>
books—books in which the richest variety of <span class='it'>recherché</span>
detail and anecdote about literary affairs, is made subservient
to the most comprehensive survey and analysis of letters
themselves, considered in respect to their important spiritual
uses. He is the only <span class='it'>savant</span> upon record who has
busied himself, without pedantry, among the <span class='it'>minutiæ</span> of
classical lore. His works will last as long as the language
in which they are written. The “Curiosities of Literature,”
the “Literary Character,” the “Miscellanies of Literature,”
the “Calamities of Authors,” and all but the present “Amenities
of Literature” are, however, but incidental labors
arising from a more extensive design—a “History of English
Literature”—of which he thus speaks. “It was my
intention not to furnish an arid narrative of books and of
authors, but, following the steps of the human mind through
the wide track of time, to trace from their beginnings the
progress and the decline of public opinions, and to illustrate,
as the objects presented themselves, the great incidents in
our national annals.” In this magnificent project the philosopher
was arrested by blindness. The “Amenities of
Literature” is a portion and in fact the beginning of the
great scheme which can now never be completed. We
need say no more to recommend it to the reader. The two
volumes before us are issued in the customary careful and
tasteful style of the Langleys.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Critical and Miscellaneous Writings of Sir Edward
Lytton Bulwer, author of “Pelham,” &amp;c. 2 vols.
Lea and Blanchard: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have read these volumes with the highest pleasure.
They embrace all of the known minor writings of Bulwer,
with the exception of his shorter fictions; and we recognize
in the collection several very excellent articles which had
arrested our attention and excited our curiosity while their
authorship was undivulged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bulwer is <span class='it'>never</span> lucid, and seldom profound. His
intellect seems to be rather well balanced than lofty—rather
comprehensive than penetrative. His taste is exquisite.
His style, in its involution and obscurity, partakes of the involution
of his thoughts. Apart from his mere intellect,
however,—or rather as a portion of that intellect—we recognize
in his every written word the keenest appreciation
of the right, the beautiful, and the true. Thus he is a man
worthy of all reverence, and we do not hesitate to say that
we look upon the charges of immoral tendency which have
been so pertinaciously adduced against his fictions, as absurdly
<span class='it'>little</span> and untenable, in the mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volumes now before us are plain evidence of the noble
spirit which has constantly actuated him. The papers
here published were written at various epochs of his life.
We look through them in vain for anything false, as a whole,
or unchivalrous, or impure, or weak, or tasteless, or ignoble.
Were we addicted <span class='it'>jurare in verba magistri</span>, there lives no
man upon whose faith we would more confidently rely than
upon that of Bulwer—no man whose opinion upon any
point involving a question of truth, or justice, or taste, we
would be more willing to adopt unexamined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have been especially pleased with an article (in the
volumes now before us) entitled “Literature Considered as
a Profession,” and with another “Upon the Spirit of True
Criticism.” Some remarks in the latter paper are quite as
applicable to our own country as to Great Britain.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To say this is good and that is bad,’ says La Bruyère,
‘is not morality.’ Very true, neither is it criticism. There
is no criticism in this country—considering that word as the
name of a science. A book comes out—it is capital, says
one—it is detestable, says another. Its characters are unnatural—its
characters are nature itself. On both sides
there is affirmation, on neither proof. In fact no science
requires such elaborate study as criticism. It is the most
analytical of our mental operations—to pause—to examine—to say
<span class='it'>why</span> that passage is a sin against nature, or that plot
a violation of art—to bring deep knowledge of life in all its
guises—of the heart in all its mysteries to bear upon a sentence
of approval or disapprobation—to have cultivated the
feeling of beauty until its sense of harmony has grown as
fine as the ear of a musician—equally sensitive to discord—or
alive to new combinations:—these are no light qualities,
and these are not qualities, it may be answered, to be lightly
lavished away. Every new book, it may be said, does not
deserve that we should so honor it. We need not invoke the
Past, and summon all Nature to hear us praise a butterfly,
or crush a bug. We may on slight works arrogate the censor—yes,
but we must first have been chosen the censor, by
the acumen we have testified on great ones. Now, when an
author who has risen into eminence, who begins to produce
an effect upon his age, whose faults it becomes necessary to
indicate as a warning, whose beauties we should illustrate
as an example—when such a man produces a new work,
what is the cant cry of the critics? ‘The peculiar merits
and failings of Mr. So and So are too well known for us at
this time of day to repeat them. The present work has all
the characteristics of the last—if it does not increase, it will
not diminish the well-earned reputation of the author.’
Then come the extracts, and a word or two at the end as
precise and lucid as those at the beginning, and——there’s
<span style='font-size:smaller'>THE CRITICISM</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my part, I please myself sometimes with drawing
the ideal picture of a good critic, as Bolingbroke drew that
of a patriot king. What a crowd of accomplishments, not
easily seen by the superficial, belong to that character!
Literature and morality are so entwined that you rarely find
the real critic unless he is also the moralist. The union is
almost necessary. In Quinctilian how beautifully the deduction
closes the dogma! and even in Johnson the habit of
moralizing gives dignity to his criticisms. In both sciences
the study of mankind, of the metaphysical nature within
us, alone insures a sound judgment: in both, without a delicate
yet profound perception of the harmonious, the beautiful,
the august, no commanding excellency is obtained.
The goodness of a man and the goodness of a book are not
such different qualities as people suppose. A person, however,
<span class='it'>may</span> be, though he is not often, a good moralist without
being a good man: to preach and practice are faculties
not inseparable. But I doubt if a man can be a great critic
who has not, at least, the elementary qualities of a good man.
I consider that he must keep the intellectual sight clear from
envy, and malice, and personal dislikes. He must examine
the work above and remote from all the petty considerations
that attach to the man. He must be on the alert for genius,
ready to encourage even a rival to himself. Where this largeness
of mind is not visible, there is always something petty
and crippled in the mind of the professional critic. He may
make one great criticism, but he cannot criticise with greatness
habitually. Perhaps he reviews some dead author—for
the dead interfere not with the living; or he wastes a world
of generosity, like Southey, in praising some rhymester of
the pantry, who is little enough while he attracts honor to
the praiser to plunge into forgetfulness the praise. The
good critic—that rare ideal, must have in him courage to
blame boldly, magnanimity to eschew envy, benevolence to
search for obscure merit. He must have genius to appreciate,
and learning to compare: he must have an eye for
beauty, an ear for music, a heart for feeling, a mind for reason.
‘We are conscious of excellency,’ says some author,
‘in proportion to the excellence within ourselves.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We wish also to call attention to a very excellent article
on the subject of “International Copyright.” The only
paper in the collection which we could have wished omitted
is one entitled “A Letter to the Quarterly Review,”—an
attempt at vindictive retaliation upon Lockhart. We admire
this gentleman quite as little as Mr. Bulwer can possibly
do, but we grieve to see an attack which has neither
vigor nor wit, and which proves nothing beyond the writer’s
wrath and utter incapacity for satire.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Pic Nic Papers. By various Hands. Edited by</span>
<span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>, Esq. <span class='it'>author of “The Pickwick Papers,”
&amp;c. 2 vols. Lea and Blanchard: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The “Introduction” to this work gives us its history.
“The premature death of a young publisher (Mr. Macrone)
inspired some of those who had known him personally, or
had been connected with him in business, with an earnest
desire to render some assistance to his widow and orphans.
They produced among themselves this work.” In the English
edition there were three volumes; the third consisting
of the “Charcoal Sketches” of Mr. Joseph C. Neal, of
Philadelphia. This edition we have not seen; but have
been astonished to hear that the London publisher has been
so discourteous as to print Mr. Neal’s compositions, and the
engravings which accompanied them, without the <span class='it'>name</span> of
the writer, or any farther acknowledgment than a few words
speaking of the whole as “from an American source.”
Comment upon such meanness seems altogether a work of
supererogation; but, in truth, we are in the habit of setting
our brethren across the water very bad examples in matters
of a somewhat similar kind. That Mr. Dickens had any
thing to do with the wrong now perpetrated, we will not,
however, believe for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contributors to the two volumes reprinted in Philadelphia
are among the most celebrated <span class='it'>literati</span> of England.
We have, for example, articles from Dickens, from Leigh
Ritchie, Allan Cunningham, Thomas Moore, W. H. Ainsworth,
G. P. R. James, Agnes Strickland and several others.
It might be supposed, of course, that the collection would be
one of high interest: but we are forced to say that it <span class='it'>is not</span>.
In a case like this, authors (who for the most part are unburthened
with pecuniary means) are called upon to furnish
<span class='it'>gratuitous</span> papers. It is not surprising that, under such
circumstances, they content themselves with bestowing
whatever MS. they may have at hand, of least value.
Scraps from memorandum-books; effusions of early years
kept only as mementos and never destined for publication;
fragments of tales or essays definitely abandoned by the
author, who has become dissatisfied with his subject or the
mode in which it was progressing—matters such as these
form invariably the staple of compilations such as this.
There is, moreover, another important consideration—one
involving a very remarkable truth. The <span class='it'>refuse</span> labor of a
man of genius is usually inferior, and greatly so, to that of
the man of common-place talent:—very much as the dregs
of the <span class='it'>Côtes du Rhone</span> are more viscid than those of Sherry
or <span class='it'>De Grâve</span>. It is only necessary to suggest this idea to
have it at once fully appreciated and understood. The man
of talent pursues “the even tenor of his way.” He is at all
times <span class='it'>himself</span>. With the all-prevalent law of action and reaction
he has nothing to do. Never excited into wild enthusiasm,
he never experiences its consequent and inevitable
depression. Never boldly soaring, he never sadly sinks.
To write well, the man of genius must write in obedience to
his impulses. When forced to disobey them—when constrained,
by the fetters of a methodical duty, to compose at
<span class='it'>all</span> hours—it is but a portion of his nature—it is but a condition
of his intellect—that he should occasionally grovel
in platitudes of the most pitiable description. And this fact
will go farther than any one hitherto adduced, to explain
the character of a fatality which has so constantly attended
genius as to have become a sure index of its existence:—we
mean the fatality of alternate high eulogium and virulent
invective. Few men are conversant with the <span class='it'>whole</span>
works of an author. Now, in the case of two critics of equal
ability, it may happen (and we know it <span class='it'>does</span> frequently so
happen) that the opinion of one may be based solely upon
the author’s best efforts, while that of the other is deduced
from some mere task-work labored out in hours of the most
utter inappetency and exhaustion. The dissent of the latter
(a dissent just if we regard only the means of judgment)
will, of course, be extravagant in denunciation, precisely in
the ratio of his astonishment and indignation at what he
supposes the corrupt panegyric of the former.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, it should not be a matter for surprise that these
“Pic Nic Papers” are very great trash, although written
by very clever men. Their general merit, in our opinion,
is below that of the mere <span class='it'>make-weight</span> of our commonest
newspapers and magazines. One or two of the articles are
not <span class='it'>very</span> bad:—Leigh Ritchie’s “Marcus Bell,” for example;
a tale entitled “Aunt Honor;” and “The Lamplighter’s
Story,” by Mr. Dickens. This last, however, is only tolerable
through the manner in which it is told. There is not a
single paper of <span class='it'>real</span> value; and more consummate nonsense
than the greater portion of the collection we never encountered
in any respectable-looking book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot conclude our notice without a protest against
the title-page. To call this paltry publication the “Pic Nic
Papers,” and affirm it to be <span class='it'>edited</span> by Mr. Dickens—thus
inducing ideas of the popular Pickwick, is a piece of chicanery
which not even the end in view can sanction. No body
of men are justified in making capital of the public’s gullibility
for purposes of charity, public or private—for any
purposes under the sun. We do not hesitate to state the
present case <span class='it'>plainly</span>. The title affixed to this work has been
designedly so affixed, that purchasers, hastily glancing at it,
may suppose it a book upon the same plan as the “Pickwick
Papers,” and <span class='it'>written</span>, as they were, by Mr. Dickens.
No one who reflects an instant can suppose the intention to
have been anything else. Now what is this but the worst
species of <span class='it'>forgery</span>?</p>

Complete in Four Volumes. With Numerous
Engravings. Carey and Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Napier’s “History of the Peninsula War” is a
work whose general features are sufficiently well understood.
In the thoroughness of its survey and in the minute and exact
particularity of its details, if not in more important and comprehensive
regards, it is equalled certainly by no other book
on the subject discussed, and perhaps by few histories of
any kind. The author’s extensive political acquaintance
with the events agitating all Europe at the period investigated,
and especially the part he bore in some of these events,
with his obvious enthusiasm for military affairs, rendered
him as fitting for the task which he has undertaken as any
individual of his age. It may be said, indeed, and not altogether
paradoxically, that he was somewhat <span class='it'>too</span> well qualified
for this task. The agitating incidents <span class='it'>quorum pars
magna fuit</span> have so forcibly impressed his imagination as
to mislead his understanding in respect to the <span class='it'>relative</span> importance
of these incidents. He discourses of the “Peninsular
Campaign” (pretty much, by the way, as all Englishmen
discourse of it) as if <span class='it'>it alone</span> were the proper subject
of all human deliberation. No one will be willing to deny
the interest which appertains to it, nor the magnitude of the
results to which it led. We mean to say, however, that,
except to Colonel Napier and the Duke of Wellington, it is
not the only important topic in the universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto the American reader of history has been able to
procure this work only from our public libraries, and the
enterprize of Messieurs Carey and Hart in placing it within
reach, is worthy of all commendation. They must have
been at unusual expense in this undertaking. The volumes
are thick octavos, and are illustrated by no less than fifty-five
lithographed plans, (which, by the way, are not very well
executed.) At the same time these publishers can scarcely
expect remuneration from a very extensive sale. By public
institutions and military men the work will be valued
and purchased. But beyond these, with few exceptions,
the public will content itself with the means already in its
power of referring to the history in our libraries. The gentlemen
in question are, of course, the best judges of their
own affairs; but it does seem to us that they have erred in
permitting the <span class='it'>foreign</span> value and reputation of the work to
influence them in making an American reprint.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Ten Thousand a Year. By the Author of The Diary of
a London Physician. Carey and Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are several circumstances connected with this book
which render it an important topic for the critic. We mean
its unusual length—the previous reputation of its author—the
peculiarity of its subject—the apparent under-current
of <span class='it'>design</span> which has been attributed to it—the wide difference
of opinion existing in regard to its merit—and, especially,
the fact of its being, if not precisely the first, yet
certainly the chief of the class of <span class='it'>periodical</span> novels—the
peculiar advantages and disadvantages of which it will afford
a good opportunity for discussing. We much regret,
therefore, that we have left ourselves no room, in the present
number of the Magazine, for an extended analysis of
the work. This we may possibly undertake in December;
contenting ourselves, in the meantime, with a few observations
at random.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears to us that a main source of the interest which
this book possesses for the mass, is to be referred to the
<span class='it'>pecuniary</span> nature of its theme. From beginning to end it
is an affair of pounds, shillings, and pence—a topic which
comes home at least <span class='it'>as</span> immediately to the bosoms and business
of mankind, as any which could be selected. The same
<span class='it'>character</span> in the choice of subject was displayed by Doctor
Warren in his “Passages from the Diary of a London Physician.”
The <span class='it'>bodily health</span> is a point of absolutely universal
interest, and was made the basis of all the excitement in
that very popular but shamefully ill-written publication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten Thousand a Year” is also “shamefully ill-written.”
Its mere English is disgraceful to an L.L.D.—would be
disgraceful to the simplest tyro in rhetoric. At every page
we meet with sentences thus involved—“In order, however,
to do this effectually I must go back to an earlier period in
history than has yet been called to his attention. If it
[<span class='it'>what?—attention?—history?</span>] shall have been unfortunate
enough to attract the hasty eye of the superficial and
impatient novel-reader, I make no doubt that by such a one
certain portions of what has gone before, and which [<span class='it'>which
what?</span>] could not fail of attracting the attention of long-headed
people as being not thrown in for nothing (and therefore
to be borne in mind with a view to subsequent explanation)
have been entirely overlooked or forgotten.” The
book is full too of the grossest misusages of language—the
most offensive vulgarities of speech and violations of grammar.
The whole <span class='it'>tone</span> is in the last degree mawkish and inflated.
What can be more ridiculous that the frequent apostrophising
after this fashion—“My glorious Kate, how my
heart goes forth towards you! And thou, her brother! who
art of kindred spirit, who art supported by philosophy and
exalted by religion, so that thy constancy cannot be shaken
or overthrown by the black and ominous swell of trouble
which is increasing around thee—I know that thou wilt
outlive the storm—and yet it rocks thee! What indeed is
to become of you all? Whither will you go? And your suffering
mother, should she survive so long, is her precious
form to be borne away from Yatton?” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no attempt at plot—but some of the incidents
are wofully ill adapted and improbable. The moralising,
throughout, is tedious in the extreme. Two-thirds of the
whole novel might have been omitted with advantage. The
character of Aubrey is a ridiculous piece of overdone sentimentality—and
in character generally the writer fails.
One of the worst features of the whole is the transparent
puerile attempt to throw ridicule upon the ministerial party
by dubbing them with silly names, supposed to be indicative
of peculiarities of person or character. While the oppositionists,
for example, rejoice in the euphonious appellations
of Aubrey, Delamere, and the like, their foes are called
Quirk, Gammon, Snap, Bloodsuck, Rotgut, Silly-Punctilio,
and other more stupid and beastly indecencies.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
